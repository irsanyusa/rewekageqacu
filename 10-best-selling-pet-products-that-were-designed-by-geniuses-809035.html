Our 15-week-old puppy took to&nbsp;these instantly, realizing just what was needed. As&nbsp;time has progressed, she is&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pickle, ringing the bells when she wants to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out and play, not just to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;wee. A&nbsp;great product for an&nbsp;intelligent pup. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@ Happy Shopper</a></p><h2>4.

Make removing dirt after a&nbsp;walk enjoyable rather than stressful.

I&nbsp;bought this to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;my&nbsp;car for when&nbsp;I take the dog to&nbsp;the beach, and it&nbsp;works really well at&nbsp;getting the sand off her. Because she’s a&nbsp;small dog, it’s also great to&nbsp;wrap around her back and under her tummy to&nbsp;pick her up&nbsp;when she’s wet and muddy. My&nbsp;dog has a&nbsp;bad back leg and doesn’t like it&nbsp;being rubbed, but with this being so&nbsp;soft, she loves&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;washes really well and looks like new once it&nbsp;is&nbsp;washed. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@ Amazon Customer</a></p><h2>7. Feel like a&nbsp;professional groomer. Your pet will always be&nbsp;cared for and pretty with this self-cleaning <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brush</a>! The thin bristles give your furry friend a&nbsp;pleasant massage feeling. The comb also has a&nbsp;special curved handle that makes it&nbsp;comfortable to&nbsp;hold.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/789/11f/21a8da57df8833f47f4a4827b2.jpg><ul><li>Easy to&nbsp;clean&nbsp;— just remove the bristles with the push of&nbsp;a&nbsp;button, then wipe off the collected fur.</li><li>Great for cats and dogs of&nbsp;all hair types.</li><li>Helps reduce shedding and also removes dirt.</li></ul><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><p><i>The groomer&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;recommended that&nbsp;I try a&nbsp;brush of&nbsp;this general type instead of&nbsp;the combination of&nbsp;pin brush and undercoat comb that&nbsp;I had previously used. A&nbsp;“self-cleaning” brush sounded too good to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true but had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;worth a&nbsp;go. And, yes, it&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;have two 9-month-old Mastin x&nbsp;GSDs (with radically different coat types) and an&nbsp;18-year-old border collie x&nbsp;West Highland terrier, and this brush works superbly well on&nbsp;all of&nbsp;them. One click of&nbsp;the button when the brush gets full and a&nbsp;weird rectangular pad of&nbsp;hair just drops straight out, ready to&nbsp;be&nbsp;picked up&nbsp;or&nbsp;vacuumed. Unlike, well, pretty much every other brush&nbsp;I have tried, this one also doesn’t seem to&nbsp;send loose hair spiraling into the air. It’s great: it&nbsp;feels very sturdy, with a&nbsp;comfortable grip, and it&nbsp;seems like it&nbsp;will last a&nbsp;good long while. Highly recommended! </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@ Persiflage</a></p><h2>8. Your pet will always have the right amount of&nbsp;water.

I’ve tried others for my&nbsp;cat, and she never used them. This one she actually uses! It’s just like a&nbsp;faucet, which is&nbsp;why she likes&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;she would only drink out of&nbsp;the kitchen sink, but that wasn’t working for&nbsp;me. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;ordered this and put it&nbsp;right next to&nbsp;the sink, so&nbsp;she’d find it&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;understand that it&nbsp;was just like the sink. Sure enough, it&nbsp;worked! I&nbsp;change the water once a&nbsp;week to&nbsp;make sure it’s always fresh for her. She loves&nbsp;it. I’ve told all my&nbsp;cat owner friends too because they have the same issue with their cats liking the sink. </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@ A&W Mavis</a></p><h2>9.

My&nbsp;mice are hardly out of&nbsp;them. They climb on&nbsp;the top, in&nbsp;the middle section, and in&nbsp;the bottom section. They haven’t chewed it&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. They have put hay in&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;extra bedding, not that they need it&nbsp;as&nbsp;it’s super warm and soft. When I&nbsp;bought&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;thought they would never use&nbsp;it. They would probably chew it&nbsp;to&nbsp;shreds. It&nbsp;would last 2&nbsp;minutes... How wrong was I.&nbsp;They love&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;was searching all around their bin cage and when I’d done that&nbsp;I thought I’d check the hammock and the 4&nbsp;mice were in&nbsp;there. So&nbsp;now I’ve ordered 8.
