This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the world’s most important and impressive archaeological finds. And here’s why.</p><p>There’s an&nbsp;area called Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument&nbsp;— it’s close to&nbsp;the small town of&nbsp;Nampa in&nbsp;southwestern Idaho. This US&nbsp;National Natural Landmark has the most extensive collection of&nbsp;fossils of&nbsp;ancient plants and animals that lived in&nbsp;North America before the Ice Age. For example, paleontologists have recently found the remains of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ancient horse that ran across green meadows about 10,000 years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d0f/699/9cc0de5140820e71ce19eeaee8.png><p>But the main discovery happened in&nbsp;1889. Several workers came to&nbsp;this area to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;well. They drilled a&nbsp;pit about 300 feet deep&nbsp;— that’s the height of&nbsp;the Statue of&nbsp;Liberty. Then, with the help of&nbsp;pumping equipment, they began to&nbsp;pump out clay.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the clay pieces seemed rather strange to&nbsp;the workers. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;small figurine of&nbsp;a&nbsp;human the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dime. It&nbsp;looked pretty old, battered by&nbsp;time and soil. The workers saw a&nbsp;carved mouth and eyes on&nbsp;its bulging head. Thick arms were pressed to&nbsp;the body. One of&nbsp;the legs was broken off. Also, there were discernible geometric patterns on&nbsp;the figurine’s arms, neck, and chest.</p><p>It&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sculpture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. Despite its simple appearance, this doll was made by&nbsp;a&nbsp;real artist of&nbsp;that time. Such ancient figures are a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;a&nbsp;developed civilization. But what was it&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;deep underground? And who created&nbsp;it? It’s unlikely we’ll ever find out. This toy is&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the ancient figurines found in&nbsp;caves in&nbsp;France and Belgium.</p><p>But unlike them, Nampa Doll puts the timeline of&nbsp;human <a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a> in&nbsp;doubt. And it’s not even so&nbsp;much about the figurine but rather about the soil where it&nbsp;was found. Workers drilled through a&nbsp;geological stratum called the Glenns Ferry Formation. The figurine was found in&nbsp;2-million-year-old clay. And that is&nbsp;the problem. Only Homo Sapiens that lived 2&nbsp;million years ago in&nbsp;America could create such a&nbsp;doll. But this is&nbsp;impossible since modern humans appeared in&nbsp;Africa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/938/a91/4745815444be866814ba3ad4d3.png><p>Nampa Doll is&nbsp;the only ancient artifact found in&nbsp;the New World. But what if&nbsp;Homo Sapiens had indeed walked around North America so&nbsp;long ago? In&nbsp;this case, it&nbsp;would cast doubt on&nbsp;many scientific discoveries and arguments of&nbsp;the last few hundred years. History will have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rewritten anew.</p><p>Perhaps, the figurine is&nbsp;much younger. It&nbsp;could have fallen to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;depth accidentally because of&nbsp;cracks in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=rock data-link=tag>rock</a> or&nbsp;volcanic activity. Maybe it&nbsp;was lying on&nbsp;the surface, but the workers pushed it&nbsp;deeper with their drilling rig. Or&nbsp;it&nbsp;got there during some kind of&nbsp;excavation. This place is&nbsp;popular among paleontologists because of&nbsp;the fossils, remember?</p><p>But some people have claimed that this figurine was a&nbsp;fake. One of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;American researcher and geologist J.W. Powell. He&nbsp;knew local Indians and saw their children playing with similar dolls. Some young guy dropped his toys close to&nbsp;the place where the workers drilled the well. The researcher was also surprised by&nbsp;the version that this fragile clay toy had been hidden deep in&nbsp;sand, gravel, and moist soil&nbsp;— and survived.</p><p>Thousands of&nbsp;years of&nbsp;floods had formed a&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;various ground materials. Then volcanoes erupted, and lava flows filled this place. All this time, the fragile statuette had been there, intact and almost undamaged. After a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;million years, workers came and drilled a&nbsp;large hole. The rig didn’t destroy the doll, either. And then the pump pulled it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the surface. All this seems very unlikely. What do&nbsp;you think?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/be9/f4c/25c8525e5e879b6b48a2cd9f6e.png><p>In&nbsp;1936, a&nbsp;married couple was walking through the streets of&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> and noticed a&nbsp;strange stone with a&nbsp;wooden bar sticking out of&nbsp;it. They took it&nbsp;home and split the rock with chisels. There was a&nbsp;hammer inside the stone. The wooden bar sticking out of&nbsp;the rock was its handle.</p><p>Okay, an&nbsp;ancient hammer got stuck in&nbsp;the stone, nothing special. They gave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;archaeologists, who analyzed the rock. It&nbsp;turned out that this rock was more than 400 million years old! And the analysis of&nbsp;the hammer showed that it&nbsp;was even older&nbsp;— 500 million years old! It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;ancient that its handle had started to&nbsp;turn into coal.</p><p>But how could this hammer appear long before dinosaurs? The first insects began to&nbsp;pop up&nbsp;at&nbsp;that time! The head of&nbsp;the hammer consists of&nbsp;96% iron. Nature couldn’t have created such a&nbsp;pure material. Obviously, it&nbsp;was created by&nbsp;people. But of&nbsp;course, the version that half a&nbsp;billion years ago, there was some kind of&nbsp;civilization doesn’t seem real.</p><p>The minerals inside ancient limestone dissolve well. Perhaps, they had penetrated into the metal head of&nbsp;the hammer and became part of&nbsp;the stone. This way, the hammer had grown into the rock. It’s difficult to&nbsp;verify this now since the hammer has become part of&nbsp;the collection of&nbsp;one museum. Its employees don’t allow conducting scientific analysis on&nbsp;this valuable exhibit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/223/3f3/d10d98566dbb63d11190dd1417.png><p>Everyone knows about the famous Stonehenge in&nbsp;the UK. The purpose of&nbsp;this stone monument is&nbsp;still unclear. But in&nbsp;2015, even more mystery was added to&nbsp;it. Scientists discovered another monument called Super-Henge. It’s hidden underground, just 2&nbsp;miles from its famous brother. And it’s 15&nbsp;times larger than Stonehenge&nbsp;— both in&nbsp;size and weight.</p><p>Each of&nbsp;the 90&nbsp;Super-Henge stones reaches 15&nbsp;feet in&nbsp;height. The rocks lie horizontally on&nbsp;the ground in&nbsp;one row, forming a&nbsp;semicircle. They originally stood upright, but someone pushed them down about 4,500 years ago. Some suggest the Super-Henge was part of&nbsp;an&nbsp;even larger structure. Perhaps it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;fence or&nbsp;a&nbsp;wall. Also, it&nbsp;resembles a&nbsp;circular arena. More details of&nbsp;this monument might still be&nbsp;hidden in&nbsp;the ground.</p><p>Scientists learned that Stonehenge had been part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big complex network of&nbsp;unique monuments. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;stones, people used poles, logs, and earthen ramparts in&nbsp;the distant past. This suggests that these monuments could have been used for some ancient ritual ceremonies. For example, the paths on&nbsp;the ground leading to&nbsp;Stonehenge coincide with the movement of&nbsp;the sun’s rays during the summer solstice.</p><p>In&nbsp;2020, the oldest stone in&nbsp;history was discovered. It’s older than any other ancient mineral and more aged than even the lowest layers of&nbsp;Earth’s crust. In&nbsp;fact, this stone is&nbsp;older than our planet! It&nbsp;was lying somewhere in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the hot sands of&nbsp;the Sahara.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9da/8d8/687035573684d8fd1ae31e9f72.png><p>Scientists analyzed isotopes of&nbsp;magnesium and aluminum on&nbsp;its surface and found that it&nbsp;was 4.566 billion years old. Our planet’s age is&nbsp;4.543&nbsp;billion. It&nbsp;was the oldest sample of&nbsp;magma from outer space in&nbsp;history. Even before our world was formed, this stone had entered our Solar System and had been patiently waiting for a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;land.</p><p>Scientists also learned that the rock was part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small destroyed protoplanet. There were many other planets in&nbsp;our Solar System billions of&nbsp;years ago. It&nbsp;was also filled with giant asteroids. They collided with one another and turned into large celestial bodies. Some of&nbsp;them split into pieces, and some became planets. These massive planets were crushing and destroying smaller ones, including that protoplanet. It&nbsp;burst into millions of&nbsp;stones, and one of&nbsp;them fell in&nbsp;the desert many years later.</p><p>Between 800 and 200&nbsp;BCE, people built the city of&nbsp;Nan Madol [Nan ma—dOll] ...on coral reefs. That place consisted of&nbsp;about 100 artificial islands. The builders created them using huge basalt blocks. They laid about 350 million tons of&nbsp;basalt on&nbsp;underwater reefs near Micronesia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4ff/709/7ac76a514ab6a48f6524be646d.png><p>Where did they get these blocks? How could they transport them and install these giant things on&nbsp;the seabed? It&nbsp;seems like a&nbsp;tricky engineering task even in&nbsp;the 21st century. It’s also unknown why people created this city and what happened to&nbsp;those who lived here.</p><p>Now its entire territory is&nbsp;overgrown with palm trees and bushes. But you can find a&nbsp;recreated map with the exact location of&nbsp;each basalt island on&nbsp;the Internet.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6v9OeqaKnpah6pbvLpWSfp6WjsW61zWZocXBpYq%2BissWlnKxlo5i2prrToqqtq12pvG7Ax6KqZpyRrnp5fZRvbHBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
