Remaining single could sometimes be because of the rigidity of beliefs and expectations you have concerning the type of man or woman you want to date. And while there is nothing wrong with having set standards and expectations, having a closed mind could either deter you from meeting some really great people, or inhibit you from trying to connect with them at all.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c7aaa682-7915-4ae6-911e-96a99552afda data-caption="Open-mindedness is one of the qualities you have to do away with as fast as you can.

Things do not always go as planned and life is not always in black and white. In this context, what this means is that while it is OK to have well-defined, set-in-stone dating plans and relationship goals, you should not be so stiff as to the methods of achieving them.</p><p>It’s OK to have sensible core values such as dating only respectful, family-oriented people, and refuse to have them shaken off, what’s not OK is to limit your search to only a tribe, or a state or some factor that should not be so relevant, especially in this modern times.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The idea of open-mindedness here is to ensure that even though you have valid emotional needs and romantic goals, do not defeat them by being restrictive with your approach.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-2bf58510-e248-44fb-acb2-120d5f4630b3 data-caption="Do not defeat your good relationship goals with your restrictive approach to getting them.

If you are close-minded, that should be one of the things you change – and it’ll be great if you begin before you get into a relationship.</p><p><strong>Sex with an open-mind</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For many, particularly in conservative African climes as ours, sex is to be initiated by the man, acquiesced to by the woman; to be done in pitch black rooms with the man on top and limited only to certain actions and predispositions.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6919ca02-e92a-49f0-a9b8-65fccd70fb61 data-caption="It's time to bin every timed and aged sex belief which should no longer have a place in this generation.
