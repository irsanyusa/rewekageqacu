A great way to walk away with the jewelry youre seeking, and to give yourself financial freedom at the same time, is to finance it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>There are a number of ways to do this.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>Finance through the jeweler</h3></p><p>Peter Meksian, the CEO of jewelry company <a href=# id=50039f23-aec5-38ef-a829-b88f54771564>Michael M</a> , called engagement rings "one of the most important purchases in people's lives."</p><p>Meksian recommends financing engagement rings if it's within your budget.</p><p>Engagement rings can be financed just as we finance our homes, education, cars, and other things of value. Most jewelry stores have in-store financing for engagement rings. Filling out a basic application with your financials will get you an answer on what your purchase budget can be. You can pay monthly or pay it off earlier, just as any other loan," Meksian said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Some major fine jewelry brands offer financing options.</p><p><a href=# id=daf77d96-f684-3187-aeaa-54f2d4f6a7fd>Blue Nile</a> , an online jewelry destination, offers a <a href=# id=a8705d45-a109-3ae4-a194-93f07507fb16>credit card</a> for consumers.
