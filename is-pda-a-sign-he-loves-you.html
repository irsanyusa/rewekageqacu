However, the adage "one man's meat is another man's poison" holds true here because many others regard PDA as a powerful love language. PDA makes them feel special.</p><p><strong>Does PDA mean he loves me?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Well, they say action speaks louder than words, and that's true. When a guy is head over heels in love with you, there are a few distinct behaviours he exhibits, PDA is one of them.</p><p>A man can be intimate with you in private without loving you, but PDA is an indication that he is proud of you and wants to show you off. He doesn't have to be overly touchy; it could be something as simple as the way he looks at you in public, how he calls your name, or how he holds your hands.</p><p>Men are portrayed as the tougher gender, yet they do have their tender moments when they fall madly in love. So if he's all touchy and friendly and clinging to your skin, there's a good chance he is in love with you.</p><p><strong>That being said, a lot of people are very uncomfortable with PDA, Why?</strong></p><p>Well, it could be due to their family background, culture, religious beliefs, ethics or simply their personality. This is why you should know your partner before passing judgement on his motives or reasons for refraining from PDA. It’s important to have open conversations with your man about such matters, to avoid unnecessary speculations and fights.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On a final note, Public Display of Affection might not entirely be a true sign of love in a relationship, but it is unmistakably a sign they’re comfortable with you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7yKxkqZyRYq5uv8igpWaglWK5sMLErGSyp6Vkhri3y5yonw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
