According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> from the University of&nbsp;Edinburgh, there might be&nbsp;some truth to&nbsp;this. According to&nbsp;science, there are many ways a&nbsp;person’s body features can influence how smart they are, and some are more surprising than others. We&nbsp;might have been right about people who wear glasses being smart, but let’s just say a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;other stereotypes are completely off.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you some body parts that science suggests could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sure sign of&nbsp;higher brain power in&nbsp;people.</p><p><h2>1. Lack of&nbsp;ear symmetry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07f/34e/19a99f54f9b7c3b930a573b08a.jpg><p>One study found that people who are less symmetrical, like those who have <a href=#>one earlobe or&nbsp;finger longer than its twin</a>, make better leaders and are able to&nbsp;avoid self-interest. It’s possible that people’s reactions to&nbsp;these unusual body parts cause them to&nbsp;develop stability.</p><p><h2>2. Being tall</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Taller</a> people are often smarter than shorter people. According to&nbsp;one theory, being tall helps give people status, so&nbsp;historically, taller people had more opportunities for leadership, allowing them to&nbsp;get more access to&nbsp;information. They would then pass down their height and status to&nbsp;their children. Taller people tend to&nbsp;have better <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>jobs</a>, allowing them to&nbsp;better educate their children who will likely inherit their height, continuing the cycle.</p><p><h2>3. A&nbsp;pointy chin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d53/ec7/a9e4705503aa81797c5a5251f2.jpg><p>Humans have also grown to&nbsp;recognize the way <a href=#>a&nbsp;man’s chin</a> looks to&nbsp;determine how smart he&nbsp;is. A&nbsp;smaller, pointy chin suggests a&nbsp;man is&nbsp;intelligent. A&nbsp;big chin suggests that a&nbsp;man was less than smart.</p><p><h2>4. Larger breasts</h2></p><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>one study</a>, women with larger breasts tend to&nbsp;have higher intelligence. Not only did women with larger breasts appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most intelligent overall, but women with average breasts were also shown to&nbsp;be&nbsp;smarter than women with small breasts. This should serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder to&nbsp;always take stereotypes with a&nbsp;grain of&nbsp;salt.</p><p><h2>5. Body hair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a46/918/632082596e8c4949c4a14d91bc.jpg><p><h2>6. A&nbsp;big head</h2></p><p>While there is&nbsp;debate over how much the size of&nbsp;the brain contributes to&nbsp;intelligence, having a&nbsp;big head can make you smarter, but not for the reasons you think. <a href=#>Lower neuron density</a> within the brain can help your brain work efficiently.</p><p><h2>7. Smaller index fingers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cca/3a2/96e20a5b40a8b676467aeac5d4.jpg><p>Finger length can predetermine SAT scores. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>One study</a> claimed boys with smaller index fingers were better than math and girls who had smaller index and ring fingers also appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more intelligent.</p><p><h2>8. A&nbsp;broad forehead</h2></p><p>According to&nbsp;the practice of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chinese face reading</a>, having a&nbsp;broad forehead is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;intelligence and skill. Generally, they are also believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;finish tasks earlier and usually don’t need things explained to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>9. Being left-handed</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e14/b71/f2e0165a49a97cacf59198e4e5.jpg><p>Left-handed people on&nbsp;average have a&nbsp;<a href=#>larger corpus callosum</a> which helps them process information quickly. They also tend to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;better developed right-brain hemisphere.</p><p><h2>10. Smaller waists than hips</h2></p><p>Women with<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> smaller waists than hips</a> or&nbsp;who have an&nbsp;hourglass figure are found to&nbsp;be&nbsp;smarter than slimmer women in&nbsp;one study; this was believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;because they had higher levels of&nbsp;omega-3 fatty acids, which give more energy and even help pregnant women to&nbsp;develop their babies’ neurodevelopment.</p><p><h2>11. Average weight</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/397/f2b/787b6c50c2a5c13f00f8c7f1dc.jpg><p>Weight, however, could make a&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;another way. One study <a href=#>claimed</a> that overweight men and women often had less grey and white brain matter in&nbsp;needed areas than not.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know any features that can showcase intelligence?
