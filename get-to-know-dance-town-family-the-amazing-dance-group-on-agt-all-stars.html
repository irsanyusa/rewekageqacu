The dance act has a culturally diversified Latin heritage and comprises of brilliant, lively young performers aged eight to 35.</p><p>The Miami-based dance group <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">auditioned</a> on AGT season 15 making it all the way to the Quarterfinals before getting eliminated. The elimination of Dance Town Family so early in the competition clearly disappointed the AGT judges. After all, their last performance was met with nothing but raving reviews.</p><p>The group got a second chance at the competition when they got a coveted wild card spot, making them the first wild card pick for the season. The troupe’s dancers have made appearances on a number of television programs, including Jennifer Lopez’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Dance</a>, and Paula Abdul’s&nbsp;Live to Dance.</p><p>For her 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, Lopez chose Dance Town Family, and the group put on a fantastic performance. As they get ready to participate in America’s Got Talent: All Stars, on NBC and Peacock, they are now prepared for a second shot at the first place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They Left Jennifer Lopez in Tears After Their Performance</h2><p>During Dance Town Family’s Super Bowl halftime performance, they delivered a routine that would leave J.Lo in tears. As detailed in Lopez’s 2022 documentary <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halftime</a>, it was revealed that the group flew to New York right before performing.</p><p>The children’s chaperone, Valeska Valencia, claimed that the Dance Town Family handled the event with no problems. The members who weren’t able to take part in the first event, according to Valeska, were pleased for their peers.</p><p>“Manny Castro trains these kids to be professionals. He trains them to do all styles, salsa, ballet, contemporary, hip hop, jazz, you name it. When they get that call, they’re ready,” Valencia said.</p><p>The group has seemingly gotten better since their first AGT run, spending the past couple of years practicing their choreography. Whether you’re a fan of Dance Town Family or not, their teamwork and skills are undoubtedly one of the best.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DetroitYouthChoirGoldenBuzzers-220x147.jpg alt="Detroit Youth Choir First ‘AGT’ Act to Earn Two Golden Buzzers from the Same Person" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xp6rZqyfYrivu9Zmm5qmk5p6tbvWp2SfmZ2eubp506GcZpmdlsequsZmm5qmk5p6qL7Orqdmp55irqjAjJqjpWWjqa6zv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
