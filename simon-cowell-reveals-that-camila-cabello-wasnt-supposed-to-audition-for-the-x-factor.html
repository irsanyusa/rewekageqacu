As many know, Cabello rose to fame on the competition show as part of the girl group Fifth Harmony, but apparently she wasn’t supposed to audition… Here’s the scoop.</strong></p><p>It’s no secret that Simon Cowell is one of the most recognized faces on talent shows worldwide. He’s been seen at the judging panel on several series, but is often remembered as the rude judge on American Idol. Following his time on American Idol, he worked as a judge and producer on The X Factor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-camila-cabello-wasn-t-supposed-to-audition-for-the-x-factor>Camila Cabello Wasn’t Supposed to Audition for The X Factor</h2><p>Cowell recently reminisced on his X Factor days, by revealing that Cabello wouldn’t have had an audition without him. According to the talent show mogul, he found Cabello crying backstage because she was too late to her audition because she was a reserve. Within the interview, he acknowledged that he didn’t know what a reserve meant.</p><p>“I said to her, ‘Well, I’m one of the producers, you just got an audition,’ and you know, when those moments work, and seeing Camilla today or Harry Styles, Leona Lewis, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, there’s been so many times luckily where I’ve been there at that moment where their career is going to go in a completely different direction. If we didn’t have those things happen, then there’d be no point making the shows,” Cowell <a href=#>said</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>It’s clear that Cowell is proud of where Cabello has went in the music industry in present day. Even though she didn’t pass her initial audition as a solo performer, she was still able to find fame. As you may remember, she was apart of the hit girl group <a href=#>Fifth Harmony</a>. Since leaving the girl group, Cabello has led a successful solo career.</p><p>Cabello is set to make her debut on The Voice this fall. Earlier this week, she announce Charlie Puth as her knockout round advisor. Due to her upbringings on The X Factor, Puth described the singer as a “motherly” coach.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_CarrieAnnInaba_EricMcCandlessABC-1.jpg alt="‘Dancing with the Stars’ Seems to Confirm Returning Pros in New Promo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKudppqurb%2BMrZ%2BarF2Yrq61y5pknJmSmrmtu4ywmKympGLAtrzPqKqenF2pvG6t1J2graGfo3qnu9Fmq6GdXa16p63CraarZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
