Before you know it you are hooked and you can not seem to drop your device. Still, you console yourself with the fact that it is just a game, after all, it's not like you are actually punching or killing people.</p><p>Unknown to you, these games are actually not just as innocent as they appear. In fact, they are the Devil’s playground. (Yes, we totally realise how cliche that is.)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Video games like Ark: Survival Evolved, Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty and Minecraft allow them to practice their Satanic virtues freely.</p><p>Satanist reverend John H. Shaw shares the truth about games like these.</p><p>In his words, “You can build every little thing—put a torch where you want it, a tunnel, a walkway, a moat. That’s very Satanic.”</p><p>Another Church of Satan member (Citizen V) sheds more light on the true nature of a survival game called Ark: Survival Evolved and how he plays.</p><p>Citizen V says, “Anyone worth my time, who enriches my life and brings something to the table—those are the people worth going out of your way for.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“The more people we can get to do stuff for us—that’s great. Responsibility to the responsible,” he adds.</p><p>Apparently, this phrase is a call for self-accountability. It is also one of the church’s mantras.</p><p>We know this all sounds crazy but unfortunately, it is the truth. Satanists say that few things are more Satanic than video games.</p><p>Church of Satan reverend named Raul says that the three tenets of Satanism are played out in games. These are indulgence and meritocracy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The third tenet—“total environments or literal pleasure domes and places of amusement and delight.”</p><p>He adds that sci-fi MMORPG Eve Online is a perfect representation of a Satanic “total environment.”</p><p>Raul says, “I would consider Eve one of the most Satanic games out there because you have so much power as an individual.</p><p>“You gain sovereignty of part of the universe. It’s a battle for control of space, expanding influence. It exercises parts of my philosophy I feel are healthy.”</p><p>His statement is backed by Shaw, who says that the money and flashy lifestyle in Grand Theft Auto V makes him feel close to his religion.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I love the fact that, when you put on a pair of pants in GTA, they fit correctly.</p><p>“You get better cars, more money, you’re more successful, you buy houses. That’s Satanic.” These were his exacts words.</p><p>Interestingly, Satanists do not believe in overindulgence. So, while they love to indulge, they also remind themselves to practice moderation.</p><p>Church of Staten reverend Shaw explains that “Ultimately, self-preservation is the highest law.”</p><p>“We advocate indulgence, but not compulsion. When you steal a car and there are police in the area, now you have the police after you. There are consequences.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Wow! Who knew games could be this complicated?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8sa3RnqWtq12uvLa%2BjJyfoqSUp7KvecCrnGaoopawtbXSoqWgZaOWwaK6yKykZpmemXq1tMSyZJqqlWK7sMCMnq2epl2WxKK%2BxGibcayYZ7t0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
