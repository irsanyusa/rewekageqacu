Over the years, he’s worked on The Voice UK alongside Tom Jones, Will.i.am, and Jennifer Hudson. For 2024, however, Murs will not be a part of the series anymore.</p><p>The singer confirmed the unfortunate news last week, saying he received the management’s decision via phone call. According to Murs, he’s getting candid with his fans, because he doesn’t want them to think that it was an “amicable decision.”</p><p>“I’m gutted. I got the call last week to say I won’t be back on the show, and it’s a bit of a shock, to be honest,” he said. “But I don’t want to sit here like other artists might, and shine and gloss this up and say, ‘It was my decision.’ I don’t want to do that.”</p><p>While he admitted being hurt by the surprising removal from the show, he still genuinely accepted his fate. Nonetheless, Murs stated that The Voice UK will definitely “find someone great” as his replacement.</p><p>“Did I want to leave? No. Will I still watch the show? Of course, but it’ll be sore thinking that could have been me,” he said.</p><p>Murs further opened up, stating that he’s had “knockbacks” in his career before. Nevertheless, he now chooses to see the glass half-full than half-empty, believing that “something exciting will come along.”</p><p>“I loved the people behind the scenes, the coaches, everyone involved, so I am absolutely gutted not to be doing it again but you have to move on, don’t you?” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-says-he-ll-miss-drinking-with-tom-jones>He Says He’ll Miss Drinking with Tom Jones</h2><p>Despite being hurt, Murs clarified that he still has great relationship with ITV. He also said that he’ll be missing Tom Jones the most, especially his champagne sessions with him.</p><p>“I’m going to miss drinking champagne after the show with him and chatting life stories but hopefully if he reads this, he might get in touch,” he said.</p><p>Following Murs’ announcement, fans were quick to think about his possible replacement on the show. Fans speculate that Danny Jones and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Lambert</a> may serve as the ITV show’s new coach.</p><p>“Now that The Voice Kids and Starstruck have been cancelled I wonder if ITV’s plan is to bring over talent from those shows – Danny Jones or Adam Lambert perhaps? or Shania Twain ideally,” one person wrote.</p><p>“Danny Jones would be a great shout,” another user wrote.</p><p>So far, The Voice UK has not given any hints about Murs’ replacement.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_GabbyWindey_RobbyHoffman_Greg-DohertyGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Gabby Windey Goes Red Carpet Official with Girlfriend Robby Hoffman" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zqWjsmWdqr%2B0ecCxnJ1llqe8rnnToZxmrp%2BesKZ51KRknKeRmLWqusZmp5qmlaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
