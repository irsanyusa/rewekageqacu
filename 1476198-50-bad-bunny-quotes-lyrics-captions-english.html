They're always listening to the radio waiting for one of my songs to come on. And when it does, they turn up the volume - and turn it back down when it's over.</li><li>If I went out to play basketball with other kids, when I came home I'd shower and go right back to the computer again. If there was a birthday party or a family activity, I would take my laptop and spend the whole day there.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16bf19d6905c7dff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inspiring Prince quotes and lyrics about love, life and music</span></p></a><h2>Memorable Bad Bunny's songs' quotes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/db9e0ae56bb7dd91.jpg><p class=align-left>Bad Bunny has established himself as one of the most successful Latin trap and reggaeton musicians.
