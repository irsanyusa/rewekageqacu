Chastain studied acting at the Juilliard School in New York City, which she attended with frequent collaborator Oscar Isaac, before making her feature film acting debut in the 2008 drama “Jolene.” Her breakthrough film year occurred in 2011 when she had six movies debut, including the acclaimed dramas “Take Shelter,” “The Tree of Life” and “The Help.” The latter film earned her an Oscar nomination for supporting actor, while “The Tree of Life” won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Her film career continued to skyrocket in 2012 with Kathryn Bigelow’s hunt-for-Osama-Bin-Laden drama “Zero Dark Thirty,” for which Chastain was Oscar nominated for best actress. She jumped to blockbusters with supporting roles in Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar” (2014) and Ridley Scott’s “The Martian” (2015) while continuing to earn critical acclaim for indie dramas such as “A Most Violent Year” (2014), “Miss Sloane” (2016) and “Molly's Game” (2017). Her portrayal of Tammy Faye Bakker won her the Oscar, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards for best actress, and she was Emmy-nominated for taking on another historical figure, the country music icon Tammy Wynette, in the Showtime limited series “George & Tammy” (2022). Her television work also includes the HBO series “Scenes From a Marriage” (2021). As an actor, Chastain has also performed on Broadway in stage productions of “The Heiress” and “A Doll’s House,” the latter title earning a Tony nomination for best actress in a play.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BpfKux0qygnJldmLWiv9OaoKdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
