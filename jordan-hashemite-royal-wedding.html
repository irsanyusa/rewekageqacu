The Hashemites hail from the House of Hashem that ruled Mecca from as early as the 10th century, and King Abdullah II is a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The last time a Hashemite wedding of this scale took place was in 1993 when Abdullah II, then a prince, married Rania Al-Yassin, born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents. The ruling couple share three other children: Princess Iman, 26, who married Jameel Alexander Thermiotis, a Venezuelan venture capitalist of Greek descent in a smaller ceremony in March; Princess Salma, 22; and Prince Hashem, 18.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As part of festivities last week, Queen Rania hosted an opulent <a href=# rel=noopener>henna party</a> for her future daughter-in-law and hundreds of women at the Madareb Bani Hashem, where she delivered a glowing welcome speech.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’ll never forget how happy his majesty and I were when Al Hussein told us he wanted to marry Rajwa,” Rania told guests, according to <a href=# rel=noopener><i>People</i></a>. “She is the perfect answer to all my prayers for him. May you always be each other’s source of happiness and support.” She also said she believes her father-in-law, King Hussein—who was proclaimed king at age 16 in 1952 and reigned until his death in 1999—would be proud of the way she has raised his grandson.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Hussein and Rajwa’s wedding day unfolds, here’s everything we know so far about the event.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What to know about Crown Prince Hussein</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Crown Prince Hussein</a> is a captain in the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army and a graduate of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, England, as well as Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2015, Hussein became the youngest ever person to chair a <a href=# rel=noopener>U.N.

In April 2001, Hamzah issued a video message claiming to be under house arrest for calling out corruption among Jordan’s leaders. In March 2022, the royal court released a letter claimed to be written by Hamzah, seeking his brother’s forgiveness. The royal has rarely been seen in public since.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who is Rajwa Al-Saif?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rajwa, a Saudi Arabian national, is an architect and the youngest daughter of Saudi businessman Khalid bin Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz al-Saif.
