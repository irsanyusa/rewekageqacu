He is best known for leading the DeMeo crew, a group involved in murder, car theft, drug dealing, and other illegal activities.</p><p>DeMeo grew up in New York, the son of Italian immigrants. After finishing high school in 1959, he started working as a loanshark. In 1966, Anthony "Nino" Gaggi of the Gambino family recruited DeMeo. DeMeo then formed his own crew, which became known for its ruthless efficiency in disposing of bodies using a method called the "Gemini Method."</p><p>The DeMeo crew expanded into various criminal enterprises, including auto theft, creating the largest car theft ring in New York City history at the time. In 1977, DeMeo formed an alliance with the Westies, an Irish-American gang, which helped secure his induction into the Gambino family.</p><p>DeMeo's brutal activities, however, such as the public murder of an innocent college student in 1978, strained his personal relationships. The FBI began investigating the crew's crimes. Tensions also grew within the Gambino family. In January of 1983, DeMeo was murdered by members of his own crew.</p><p>In the aftermath of his death, several DeMeo crew members were indicted and convicted. DeMeo's life has been portrayed in books like "Murder Machine" (1992) and films like "The Iceman" (2012). His actions had a lasting impact on his family, with his son Albert struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder later in life.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>September 7</a>, <a href=#>1942</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Brooklyn, New York, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Silent Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Horse</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Virgo</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>January 10</a>, <a href=#>1983</a> (aged 40)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Murdered</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><br><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1983-01-20</a> American gangster Roy DeMeo is found murdered in his car trunk after disappearing a few days earlier</li></ul><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Gangsters</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwvs6yZJ2dnZq8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
