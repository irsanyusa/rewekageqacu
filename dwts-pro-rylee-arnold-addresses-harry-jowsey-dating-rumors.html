During her conversation with Joe Vulpis, Arnold addressed the rumors that she and her celebrity dance partner Harry Jowsey are dating.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rylee-arnold-denies-harry-jowsey-dwts-kiss>Rylee Arnold Denies Harry Jowsey DWTS Kiss</h2><p>During <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">last week’s Taylor Swift Night</a> on DWTS Season 32, Arnold and Jowsey were eliminated from Season 32. In the time they were competing together, rumors were flying about a possible romance. In their final dance, some people even thought they might have kissed.</p><p>The pair danced a Rumba to Swift’s song “August.” At one point, their faces were very close together. Judge Bruno Tonioli told them that “the chemistry was tangible.” He asked, “Were you kissing actually?”&nbsp;Jowsey jokingly replied, “Yeah, a little bit.” He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later denied</a> that it was a kiss.</p><p>“There wasn’t a kiss. There was not,” Arnold told Vulpis. “Which is interesting, ’cause I’m like, what, why would we kiss in the middle of the dance? Like, of all places in the dance, it’s gotta be, like, the beginning or the end. But the middle?”</p><p>Arnold said she thought that “the shadows or the camera angle really made it look like we kissed.” She was surprised when Jowsey said the kiss happened, saying, “Harry! I didn’t give you permission to say that.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FORMER ‘DWTS’ CELEBRITY NICK VIALL SAYS HARRY JOWSEY, RYLEE ARNOLD ROMANCE IS A PUBLICITY STUNT</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jowsey-gifted-arnold-a-bracelet>Jowsey Gifted Arnold a Bracelet</h2><p>During the podcast, Arnold also talked about the bracelet Jowsey gifted to her. She called the item a “thank you for an amazing season, amazing time together.” She said, “I had a hard time accepting it, ’cause it is literally the most beautiful bracelet I’ve ever seen in my entire life.”</p><p>Arnold said she hopes to remain friends with Jowsey, who came to her family’s Thanksgiving get-together last week. She admitted that they were “the most talked-about couple” on the show this season, which made her think, “I have to be careful with everything that I do.”</p><p>The dancer also addressed the video of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her and Jowsey holding hands</a> while leaving a concert. She said it was “a safety thing,” as they made their way through a crowd of people. At one point, she said that she and Jowsey are “both single.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_FantasiaBarrino_-Kevin-WinterGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Why Fantasia Barrino Initially Declined Her Role in ‘The Color Purple’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuvtilnJ5lkae7sLjDZpidnKKawLSx0mafmqqirnqru9asnLJllJbBqrrGZqmupZ%2BnwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
