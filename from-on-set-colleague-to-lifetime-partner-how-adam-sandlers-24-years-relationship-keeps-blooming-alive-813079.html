Meanwhile, Adam Sandler was already a&nbsp;well-known and prosperous actor who rose to&nbsp;prominence in&nbsp;the 1990s with films such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Happy Gilmore</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Wedding Singer</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Billy Madison</i></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f0/0e2/c7da6e53aebed4d21bd7f7bfce.jpg><p>ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News</p><p>They got to&nbsp;know one another on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;Adam’s 1999 film<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i> Big Daddy</i></a><i>, </i>where Jackie portrayed a&nbsp;waitress. Indeed, the aspiring actress met the star, Rob Schneider, while shooting a&nbsp;cameo scene, and he&nbsp;later helped her meet Adam Sandler, one of&nbsp;his close friends.</p><p>During his acceptance speech for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mark Twain Prize</a> for American Humor in&nbsp;March 2023, Adam provided additional details about his first encounter with Jackie, which he&nbsp;described as&nbsp;his “favorite night” ever. He&nbsp;explained that he&nbsp;attended a&nbsp;“Stephen Dorf” birthday party with his buddy Adam Venice. At&nbsp;the party, he&nbsp;was introduced to&nbsp;Jackie by&nbsp;his friend Dallas, and from that moment, he&nbsp;found himself captivated by&nbsp;her. Adam praised her kindness and beauty and how she habitually boosted his confidence by&nbsp;telling him he&nbsp;was great at&nbsp;everything. “In&nbsp;her eyes, I&nbsp;was the best. At&nbsp;least, that’s how she made me&nbsp;feel,” he&nbsp;jokingly added.</p><p><h2>4&nbsp;years later, he&nbsp;popped the question.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8bf/09f/aaa3a657eea4e8f634fafb7050.jpg><p>Mary Evans/Allstar/Graham Whitby Boot/East News<span>, </span>Allstar/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News</p><p>Following the beginning of&nbsp;their romance, the couple co-starred in&nbsp;several other films in&nbsp;which Jackie emerged, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>50&nbsp;First Dates,</i></a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Just Go&nbsp;With&nbsp;It,</i></a> and many others. While still actively working together, they became a&nbsp;lifelong couple and married on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>June&nbsp;22, 2003</a>.</p><p>“I&nbsp;played <a href=# title=basketball data-link=tag>basketball</a> that afternoon, trying to&nbsp;calm down, and then&nbsp;I was driving, I&nbsp;was saying stuff out loud and trying&nbsp;to, you know, make sure&nbsp;I hit all of&nbsp;the right things so&nbsp;she would remember nice stuff, and&nbsp;I did all right,” Adam recalled to&nbsp;the day he&nbsp;proposed to&nbsp;Jackie. The couple exchanged vows outside at&nbsp;a&nbsp;Malibu estate in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;large celebrity guest list that included Sharon Osbourne and <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston" data-link=tag>Jennifer Aniston</a>.</p><p><h2>They crowned their love by&nbsp;welcoming 2&nbsp;daughters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45c/17b/1729ed5a6794e59d626798686b.jpg><p>Vinicius Poersch/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>The happy couple welcomed Sadie, now 16&nbsp;years old, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>May 2006.</a> Adam declared shortly after her birth, “The child is&nbsp;healthy!

I&nbsp;eat dinner at&nbsp;six or&nbsp;seven.” He&nbsp;joked, “If&nbsp;someone makes me&nbsp;stay out until 10:30&nbsp;at night, I’m angry the entire next day because I’m exhausted.”</p><p>In&nbsp;November 2022, Adam let his daughters write him a&nbsp;speech for his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gotham Awards</a> win that turned out hilarious. “Thank you Mommy for putting up&nbsp;with Daddy and his crazy mood swings all these years,” Sandler read to&nbsp;the audience. “Now that truly is&nbsp;a&nbsp;feat deserving of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lifetime achievement award.”</p><p><h2>Jackie is&nbsp;her husband’s staunchest ally.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc7/c7a/57fd305b48a05f2870b724588e.jpg><p>Every successful man needs a&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;support and cheer him on&nbsp;in&nbsp;good and bad times.

Sandler recalled when Jackie helped him while shooting a&nbsp;kissing scene with his longtime coworker, Jennifer Aniston. “The only awkward part is&nbsp;hearing my&nbsp;wife on&nbsp;the side going, ‘Harder! Harder! Kiss her harder!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Adam chuckles.</a></p><p>Adam also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that his wife and daughters had watched his kissing scene with Jennifer.

The actor admitted that his wife pushed him to&nbsp;accept roles that he&nbsp;initially thought would be&nbsp;challenging, like the one in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Uncut Gems.</i></a></p><p>“I&nbsp;read&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;loved the movie, but&nbsp;I was scared to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. Then I&nbsp;asked Jackie to&nbsp;read&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;this together, me&nbsp;and Jackie, we&nbsp;discuss what I’m going to&nbsp;do, and she gives me&nbsp;the strength and courage to&nbsp;jump into this stuff,” Adam<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> confessed.</a></p><p><h2>Deeply in&nbsp;love after 24&nbsp;years together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6dd/4fd/331b0653878fd4ecb25839a319.jpg><p>Adam and Jackie have been together for 24&nbsp;years now, but time has not changed a&nbsp;thing about their romance&nbsp;— in&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;has grown stronger than ever. When they celebrated their anniversary in&nbsp;2020, the actor recalled on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> how “22&nbsp;years ago today we&nbsp;locked eyes and fell deep.” Adam wrote, “Love you my&nbsp;forever girl,” voicing his joy in&nbsp;celebrating 22&nbsp;years with his wife.</p><p>There is&nbsp;only one secret to&nbsp;keeping such a&nbsp;close <a href=# title=bond data-link=tag>bond</a>: trust and affection. Sandler <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoke </a>candidly about it&nbsp;and said, “Just spending time together. Make sure that you don’t run off too long and hang out together.” In&nbsp;addition, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stresses</a> the value of&nbsp;being open and spending quality time, “just an&nbsp;hour hanging out together makes&nbsp;us rocking again.”</p><p>We&nbsp;all will agree that Adam Sandler deserves all the success, loving family, and friends he&nbsp;got. He&nbsp;has proven himself that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not just a&nbsp;talented man, but is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;kind human being who does not doubt to&nbsp;stand up&nbsp;straight to&nbsp;<a href=#>help</a> other people, especially his beloved ones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLOzu8xmpqdlo5rBbq%2FOpaOemZeqsm7Azmajop6VqbausYypmKusnpq%2FbrTOsGSanJGierStzZ2jnqqjYn91ediemKurXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW63xJ6nrGWSobywucinnmaZnJ7DpnmXamppb2lk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
