And if the past seasons are any indication, we are in for a lot of amazing performances and shocking reveals. The Hawk is guaranteed to be one of those, with their golden, metallic costume and huge wings.</strong></p><p>But who could the celebrity be under the Hawk mask? And what clues point to their identity? Let’s go through all that and make our final prediction!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEM4hlN_cyA</p>The Hawk performs “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting” on The Masked Singer Elton John Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>In the Hawk’s clues, he mentioned that “as a young bird, [he] was always hanging out with adults” and that he “grew up pretty fast into the family business.” We see him looking at a full moon in the distance. Around other birds his age, he was super shy, like a “total reject,” until he heard a song that changed his life “in the blink of an eye.” It was heavy guitar chords that got his “teen heart beating.”</p><p>We see a treasure chest on the screen while the Hawk explains, “this fast, raw music” blew up his world. Next he asks, “The fall out? Boards, brawn, and bruises.” He built his own voice in his own way and had the time of his life touring. A “Greetings From New York” postcard is shown on a dashboard. Finally, he realize that being a reject is “totally fine” by him!</p><p>The Hawk’s last clue was a tiny dancer, who brought out of framed photo of Miley Cyrus. Hawk replied, “Just like Elton John, I too have collaborated with Miley Cyrus.”</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO’S PERFORMING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Hawk</h2><p>Ken Jeong was eager to give a prediction, thinking this could be Cole Sprouse because of The Suite Life‘s crossover episode with Hannah Montana. Nicole thought this might be Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy. Robin said he doesn’t recognize the voice, but guessed it’s Corey Feldman or Austin Butler. Fans online liked the Corey Feldman guess, also throwing out Tyler Posey, Billy Idol, Jimmy Fallon, and Mitchell Musso as potential options.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Hawk on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>All the clues and the voice only point to one person!

But let’s get into the rest of the clues.</p><p>The moon is a reference to his show Teen Wolf, which may be what he’s most known for. He also has a New York connection from the movie Maid in Manhattan. The “family business” checks out too because his dad is an actor and writer. He also mentioned “boards” and surfboards are the trophy for Teen Choice Awards, which he has won multiple of before. And he had his first kiss with Miley Cyrus!</p><p>Keep up to date on everything The Masked Singer right here, and don’t miss this season on FOX.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_Grimes_ElonMusk_Taylor-HillGetty-Images.jpg alt="Grimes Begs Ex Elon Musk in Now-Deleted Tweet: ‘Let Me See My Son’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZiWxKx7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
