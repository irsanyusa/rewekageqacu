The visibly angry woman waited until the guests began eating before ordering those without Asoebi (a Yoruba traditional attire) to leave.</p><p class=align-left>She emphasized that if they wanted to reach the age of 70 like she did, they should depart immediately. “Those of you that didn’t buy my asoebi go out; if you want to turn 70 like me, respect yourself and go out. I am speaking with anger, if you eat my food, it will come out bad for you,” she said.</p><p class=align-left>This unexpected demand caught the guests off guard and created a tense atmosphere at the party. With no other option, the guests reluctantly complied with the woman's demand and left the arena. Frustration and disappointment filled the air as they made their way towards the exit.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGllaoRxfpJmmK%2BnmZl6prnBmqmrmaOosqV5yKetoqyRqbawuoycmKucXWx9bsXEmqlmr5%2Birq95wqGYrJ2UYrS2sdKtqmaokafBunnTq5ynnKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
