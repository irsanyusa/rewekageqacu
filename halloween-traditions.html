There is a special atmosphere in many parts of Scotland even to this day where, as daylight fades, the flames of Hallowe’en bonfires show up ancient ramparts of castles and buildings where devilish deeds once may have been done.</p><p>Robert Burns, Scotland’s greatest bard, wrote extensively of how ancient beliefs had survived well into the Christian era, as he twisted stories of witchcraft and the devil with the traditions kept alive during Hallowe’en. His 1785 poem ‘Hallowe’en’ details many of the national customs and legends surrounding the festival which persisted even with the introduction of Christianity.</p><p>Burns was also fond of a spooky tale or two, as evidenced by one of his most famous poems, Tam O'Shanter. The poem details Tam's trip home from the pub on his faithful horse, Meg and an unfortunate run in with a number of witches, warlocks and a bagpipe-playing Devil!</p><h2>History lives on</h2><p>What is remarkable is how so much of the pagan past persists to this day. Bonfires, which once were lit to scare away the undead, still illuminate the October sky. Lanterns, which in Scotland were always carved out of a turnip - not a pumpkin - are fashioned for the same purpose.</p><p>Although the act of ‘trick or treating’ is very much an American notion, Scotland does have its own version. Traditionally children would dress up in old clothes to go ‘guising’ – a shortened form of the word disguise – and would go around their friends’ and neighbours’ houses, performing songs, jokes, stories, and tricks in return for gifts of fruit or nuts. Today these worlds have collided and trick or treating is far more prominent - though you will still get a few traditionalists looking for a little routine before they hand over those sweet treats.</p><p>This Hallowe'en, as the night sky darkens, fires are lit, and the festivities commence, it's fun to know that the trick or treaters, and the guisers, both young and old, are treading in the footsteps of their Scottish ancestors.</p><p>Happy Hallowe’en!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjqKlrKiZp661tc6nZqGZnKG8uLHEp2StqpGZtrW1zqeq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
