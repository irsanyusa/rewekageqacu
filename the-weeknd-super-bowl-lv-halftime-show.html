Still, the NFL is settling on a familiar strategy: book a popular musical act for the halftime show, to draw the not insignificant amount of the game’s 100+ million viewers who tune in for a televised concert more than the game. On Thursday, Pepsi, the NFL and Roc Nation announced that the <a href=#>The Weeknd,</a> the versatile, massively popular pop star will perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl LV Halftime Show, which will air on CBS.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is the second year in which Roc Nation, <a href=#>Jay-Z’s</a> entertainment company, has collaborated with the NFL and Pepsi to select the Super Bowl halftime performer. Last year’s show, which generated <a href=#>much enthusiasm</a> and <a href=#>many memes</a>, was co-headlined by <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez and Shakira</a>. “The Weeknd has introduced a sound all his own. His soulful uniqueness has defined a new generation of greatness in music and artistry,” Jay-Z said in a statement. “This is an extraordinary moment in time and the Pepsi Super Bowl LV Halftime Show is going to be an extraordinary experience with an extraordinary performer.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Named one of <a href=#>TIME’s 100 most influential people in the world</a> this year, The Weeknd’s 2020 album <i>After Hours</i> is the no. 1 most streamed R&B album of all time (followed by his 2016 album <i>Starboy</i> at no. 2); and his ubiquitous hit track “Blinding Lights” has spent a record-breaking 46 weeks on Billboard’s Pop Songs airplay chart. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“‘Blinding Lights’</a> is 2020’s best pop single, very ’80s-influenced, but it’s from an album that’s otherwise very introspective,” Elton John wrote about The Weeknd for <a href=#>the Time 100</a>. “He has so many different types of music tucked up his sleeve that he incorporates into his vision. He’s not interested in commerciality for commerciality’s sake, but he’s one of the biggest-streaming artists on Spotify. Like <a href=#>Prince</a>, he marches to his own beat. That’s an exemplary way for an artist to be.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prince’s <a href=# rel=noopener>performance</a> at Super Bowl in XLI, in 2007 during a steady Miami rain, is widely considered the best of all time. The Super Bowl halftime pick often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">draws criticism</a>—the choice of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maroon 5</a> two years ago, before Roc Nation got involved in the selection process, was widely panned. Maroon 5 <a href=#>got the gig</a> after <a href=#>Rihanna turned it down</a> because she disagreed with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL’s response</a> to Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the National Anthem. But The Weeknd, a Toronto-born son of Ethiopian immigrants whose given name is Abel Tesfaye, seems like a safe choice. During a time of great uncertainty, stress and division, featuring an artist who’s emerged as a global icon—and who’s responsible for the one song in 2020 we just can’t get out of our heads—can bring comfort, and even joy, to Super Bowl viewers who likely won’t be gathering at their usual parties to watch the big game. “We all grow up watching the world’s biggest acts playing the Super Bowl and one can only dream of being in that position,” says The Weeknd. “I’m humbled, honored and ecstatic to be the center of that infamous stage this year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucWFlhnmFjq2fnmWnmrKsusNmqq6olad6o7vWpWSlrl2drq2y06KknmWjnby4ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
