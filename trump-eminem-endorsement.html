I’m always right,” Trump said then in his remarks. “I know a winner when I see one. And Donald Trump is telling you, right now, Slim Shady is a winner. He’s got brains. He’s got guts. And he’s got Donald Trump’s vote. Ladies and gentlemen, our great candidate, Slim Shady.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Eminem himself also spoke at the “convention,” in a rhetorically vapid parody of official party speeches.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Americans like you and me and like all of us have been given hills to climb and the strength to climb these hills, and because we have made that hard journey, we can finally see the valley below. And what is below that valley, you ask? I don’t know. But nothing will stop us from getting there,” he deadpanned. “Democrats and Republicans alike, and that other guy, they had conventions, and they looked cooler than this one, but so what? So what, I say to them. And what am I running for, you ask? I don’t run from anything. That’s the thing. I tackle the issues head on.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In his freestyle on Wednesday night, however, Eminem had a much clearer message.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We better give Obama props, cuz what we got in the White House now is a kamikaze that’ll probably cause a nuclear holocaust,” he rapped. “And any fan of mine who’s a supporter of his, I’m drawing in the sand a line, you’re either for or against.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWdtfnOCjq2prqWgYrKutc2epGadnpm8s7%2FEppynrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
