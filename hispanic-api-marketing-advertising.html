She said that in the five years since H Code’s launch, the company has seen more brands make the switch from linear TV to digital, as well as shift to more personal messages that speak to different cultural segments of the population.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Traditionally in marketing and media, brands and agencies went in with this concept of general market or total market,” she said. “But by trying to speak to everyone, they’re speaking to no one.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX522tLzAp6CcZZGltm65wKuinqyZo7RurcOvnKusmai2r7M%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
