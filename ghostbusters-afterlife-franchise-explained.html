The beloved 1984 horror-action-comedy has already spawned two sequels, and on Friday, a fourth <a href=#>Ghostbusters</a> film will emerge. <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> is directed by Jason Reitman, who is best known for films like <i>Juno</i> and <i>Up in the</i> Air, and who is also the son of original <i>Ghostbusters</i> director Ivan Reitman.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The new movie stars <i>Stranger Things</i>’ Finn Wolfhard (no stranger to <a href=# rel=noopener>wearing a Ghostbusters costume</a>), Mckenna Grace, Carrie Coon and Paul Rudd, and it takes the ghost-busting action from the streets of New York City to a small town in Oklahoma. Although it is extremely indebted to the original movie (it’s not a spoiler to say that a <a href=#>familiar face</a> or two appears), <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> is actually a bit of a departure from <a href=#>the ‘80s movies</a>—and even a departure from the <a href=#>2016 film</a> whose approach to rebooting the franchise sparked an ugly controversy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, if you’ve got questions about <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> ahead of its premiere on Nov. 19, who ya gonna call? We’ve got you covered. We don’t bust ghosts but we <i>can</i> answer questions.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>The sequel is about the next generation of Ghostbusters</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ghostbusters-afterlife-1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> focuses on Callie (Coon), a single mother, and her two kids, teenage Trevor (Wolfhard) and awkward wiz-kid Phoebe (Grace). Facing eviction, they have no choice but to leave the city and head for the dilapidated old farmhouse that Callie’s estranged father left them after his death. They hit the road and make their way to Summerville, Okla., a small town where nothing normally ever happens—but lately, there’s been a lot of scientifically inexplicable seismic activity, as Phoebe’s new teacher Chad Grooberson (Rudd) explains. As Phoebe makes her first friend in her excitable classmate who just goes by the nickname Podcast (Logan Kim) and Trevor begins crushing on his coworker Lucky (Celeste O’Connor), everybody finds themselves embroiled in a ghostly adventure—and it turns out the Proton Packs and broken-down Ecto-1 in the farmhouse garage might actually be their inheritance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though initial trailers for the film were somewhat coy, promos that have come out closer to the release (not to mention a flood of spoilers from a surprise showing at New York Comic Con in October) have made it pretty clear that <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> will indeed feature some characters from the ‘80s movies. <i>Afterlife</i> is a direct sequel to those two, and there are several plot points that directly reference or echo the story of the original. (<i>Ghostbusters 2</i> is presumably also canon, but <i>Afterlife </i>doesn’t really explicitly reference it to the same extent.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To say more about how <i>Afterlife</i> connects with the original <i>Ghostbusters</i> might venture too far into spoiler territory, but let’s just say that there are some characters (human <i>and</i> ghost) that reappear, as well as some additional connections and plenty of Easter eggs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Afterlife</i> is not, however, related to the 2016 <a href=#><i>Ghostbusters</i> directed by Paul Feig</a>. That film, which starred <a href=#>Melissa McCarthy</a>, Kristen Wiig, <a href=#>Kate McKinnon</a> and <a href=#>Leslie Jones</a> as an all-women team of Ghostbusters, was a true reboot of the series. Some of the <a href=#>original cast members</a> did appear in cameo roles, but as new characters. That <i>Afterlife</i> exists and has no connection to the 2016 movie is somewhat of a touchy subject. Feig’s film got a mixed critical reception at best, but it’s infamous for sparking an ugly, misogynistic backlash among so-called fans of the original who were upset that a group of women, rather than the old guys, were busting ghosts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The controversy, combined with a very disappointing performance at the box office, prompted Sony to abandon a plan for a sequel. Instead, they developed a third movie set in the original continuity, eventually getting some of the original cast and Ivan Reitman’s son Jason on board, with his father producing. (The controversy didn’t quite end there; <a href=#>Reitman’s</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>comment, in a 2019 interview</a>, that his film would “hand the movie back to the fans” was met with much consternation, though he <a href=# rel=noopener>later said</a> he was misinterpreted and he admired Feig’s film.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> is very much a direct continuation of the original <i>Ghostbusters</i>. However, it’s also a very, very different sort of movie in surprising ways—some of which are more effective than others.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Ghostbusters: Afterlife has a very different setting and tone than the originals</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ghostbusters-afterlife-4-copy.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Ghostbusters</i> was beloved in part because it was a mashup of several different genres at once—comedy, horror and action. <i>Afterlife</i> is all of these things, but it adds a fourth genre to the mix: it’s a coming-of-age story, too. (In many ways, it’s more akin to <i>Stranger Things</i>’ loving ‘80s nostalgia than the actual ‘80s movies, and not just because of Wolfhard’s presence in both.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For as much as toxic parts of the fandom complained about the 2016 movie’s <a href=#>female protagonists</a>, they so far aren’t making too much of a stink about the fact that <i>Afterlife</i>’s main character, Phoebe, is a young woman. Some spoilery nepotism aside, the characters in the 2016 film are closer to the original Ghostbusters than Phoebe, brother Trevor and their diverse friends are.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the original Ghostbusters—Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (<a href=#>Dan Aykroyd</a>), Egon Spengler (the late Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson)—were middle-aged men starting a business together, this next generation of Ghostbusters are adolescents. Rather than the somewhat grimy setting of New York City in the ‘80s, <i>Afterlife</i> takes place in a small town that’s dripping with Americana—a place where the local malt shop is somehow still bustling and it’s basically golden hour all day long. It’s not quite saccharine, but it’s certainly sweet. The original films, meanwhile, had a bit more of a flippant edge to them, and they never really tried to be heartwarming in the way that <i>Afterlife</i> is.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are still plenty of wisecracks, light scares and some action sequences that are far more kinetic and elaborate than anything in the first two films, but despite being so closely tied to the originals, <i>Afterlife</i> fundamentally feels like a different movie. <i>Ghostbusters </i>and <i>Ghostbusters 2</i> were adult comedies that kids also liked. <i>Afterlife</i> is much more intentionally family-friendly.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Ghostbusters: Afterlife takes the franchise in a new direction—until it doesn’t</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ghostbusters-afterlife-3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you’re looking for a pretty fun movie about some kids going on an adventure and finding themselves, <i>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</i> works, for the most part. The Easter eggs and connections to the original films—basically its place in <i>Ghostbusters</i> as a franchise—are somewhat ancillary and borderline unnecessary. A kid who has never seen the first two movies could very well walk into the theater and enjoy <i>Afterlife</i> without any prior knowledge or nostalgia.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However—and it’s again hard to talk about this without spoiling things too explicitly—at a certain point, the nostalgia and debt to the ‘80s movie basically consume <i>Afterlife</i>, Muncher-style. To give an oblique hint of what we’re talking about: <i>Afterlife</i> features two post-credits scenes. Neither scene features Phoebe, Trevor or any other “new” character introduced in the film.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, even as <i>Afterlife</i> does in many ways stretch what viewers can expect from a <i>Ghostbusters </i>movie—introducing new themes, tones and types of characters—it also feels the need to stick to the originals. For viewers who are excited to spot Easter eggs and feel that nostalgic rush when an old favorite steps into the frame, this is great. For those who were enjoying a surprisingly new, surprisingly effective sort of story in the <i>Ghostbusters</i> universe, it’s perhaps a bit of a bummer. The franchise pivoted after the ugliness the 2016 reboot sparked, managed to find a way to do something new even while going straight back to the originals, but in the end felt it had to be more explicit in proving its nostalgic ‘80s bonafides.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ghostbusters, famously, ain’t afraid of no ghost, but <i>Afterlife</i> seems to be afraid to <i>really</i> take the Ghostbusters franchise into a new direction, even as it proves that there’s the potential to make the premise work in a different setting with a different tone. What’s the point of relying on the bankability of existing IP, alas, if not to shell out enough familiar elements of that IP to fill seats in a theater? Far from busting ghosts, <i>Afterlife</i> attempts to revive the dead.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There will likely be additional sequels to <i>Afterlife</i>, assuming it does well at the box office. (Critics have, for the most part, been mixed on the film, especially because of that nostalgic nose-dive at the end.) Whether those future installments continue to expand the Ghostbusters world or retrench in the familiar remains to be seen. The living don’t know what life is like after <i>Afterlife</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWJlfXZ%2FjqCfqKukl8K0wMSrqmaZlqmys7jIn5xmnqKWu6S0yKycZp2opbmitc2em2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
