Wagging tails tell&nbsp;us that our dogs are open for interaction, and their persuasive looks mean that they want attention or&nbsp;some treats. The way dogs develop human-like emotions and behavior has always been a&nbsp;subject of&nbsp;scientific research. <a href=#>Studies</a> have shown that dogs have all the same brain structures that produce emotions in&nbsp;humans, and there are a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;ways in&nbsp;which our dogs show&nbsp;us their <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> we&nbsp;have studied the ways in&nbsp;which dogs demonstrate their love and affection and we&nbsp;can’t wait to&nbsp;share this info with you!</p><p><h2>1. Gazing into your eyes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e6/d78/b825495e598acd255517f0b2c5.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the ways in&nbsp;which dogs say “I&nbsp;love you” is&nbsp;staring directly into your eyes. Scientists have <a href=#>found out</a> that <strong>by&nbsp;gazing into our eyes dogs develop strong emotional bonds with humans</strong>, just like people do&nbsp;when looking into each other’s eyes. This human-like mode of&nbsp;communication was probably acquired by&nbsp;dogs during domestication, increasing the oxytocin (the social hormone) level in&nbsp;both dogs and their owners.</p><p><h2>2. Bringing you their toys.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc7/edf/61174a558d84b426ea656d7f94.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your dog brings you its favorite <a href=# title=toy data-link=tag>toy</a>, you can be&nbsp;sure that the love your pet has for you is&nbsp;strong and unconditional. <strong>Dogs are very <a href=#>possessive</a> about their toys</strong>, bones, and other chews and they would normally protect them from others. So, if&nbsp;your dog proudly offers you its toy or&nbsp;bone and even pushes it&nbsp;forward encouraging you to&nbsp;take&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;means your pet trusts you, loves you, and feels safe when you are near.</p><p><h2>3. Yawning when you yawn.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b0/3ac/8c05d05573a8ed5a9e0f8fc05c.jpg><p>Recent <a href=#>studies</a> have shown that, just like humans, dogs yawn contagiously, and those dogs who have a&nbsp;<strong>strong bond with their owners yawn together with them</strong>. Since contagious yawning in&nbsp;humans is&nbsp;closely connected to&nbsp;empathy, some researchers think this might be&nbsp;the case with dogs too. While scientists try to&nbsp;explain this phenomenon, you can do&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple test to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;your dog truly loves you&nbsp;— just yawn and see what happens!</p><p><h2>4. Sleeping with you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be5/fc2/f9445457d78e7965480c737762.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your dog sleeps in&nbsp;your bed it’s a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;your pet being loyal to&nbsp;you. Researchers have proven that <strong>sleeping with a&nbsp;dog in&nbsp;one’s bed or&nbsp;somewhere in&nbsp;the room can be&nbsp;comforting for some people</strong> and improves sleeping efficiency for others. “To&nbsp;have a&nbsp;purring cat or&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-behaved dog nearby may be&nbsp;very relaxing and conducive to&nbsp;sleep,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> Dr. Lois Krahn, a&nbsp;sleep medicine specialist.</p><p><h2>5. Wagging their tails.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c1/9e0/30fa1b55238b1fe658a99d61fc.jpg><p>A&nbsp;wagging tail is&nbsp;a&nbsp;special <a href=#>language</a> dogs use to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;us. If&nbsp;your dog wags its tail, it&nbsp;can mean a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;things and there are many ways to&nbsp;interpret these signs. In&nbsp;any case, by&nbsp;wagging its tail your <strong>dog </strong><strong>tells</strong><strong> you that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;open for interaction with you and emotionally engaged</strong> in&nbsp;everything that’s going on&nbsp;around.</p><p><h2>6. Raising eyebrows and showing tongues.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/400/6d9/1b9b6e5e44994d7daefa7b9e37.jpg><p>Scientists have <a href=#>discovered</a> that dogs <strong>produce many more facial movements when humans are looking at&nbsp;them</strong>. These movements include raising eyebrows to&nbsp;make their eyes look bigger (to&nbsp;seem even cuter to&nbsp;humans) and showing their tongue.</p><p><h2>7. Cuddling with you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/177/414/d519685ce89318fba680e77f12.jpg><p>While there is&nbsp;controversy over whether dogs like being hugged or&nbsp;not, scientists <a href=#>believe</a> that they do&nbsp;love cuddles. By&nbsp;cuddling <strong>dogs strengthen their bond with humans and show their affection</strong>. Being physically closer to&nbsp;their owner is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;way in&nbsp;which dogs make themselves feel comfortable and secure.</p><p><h2>8. Leaning on&nbsp;you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4a/844/f5338355188d31b980d86a17f9.jpg><p>Dogs are social pack animals by&nbsp;nature and they <a href=#>seek closeness</a> with their pack members, including&nbsp;us humans. If&nbsp;your dog loves you and trusts you, it&nbsp;will lean on&nbsp;you whenever it&nbsp;looks for physical and emotional support. In&nbsp;other words, dogs lean on&nbsp;us because <strong>they see in&nbsp;us those who can protect and comfort them.</strong></p><p><h2>9. Letting you touch its head.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ed/853/30b9915d6dabea95b2ef890bf5.jpg><p>Another sign that proves your dog’s love and loyalty is&nbsp;when it&nbsp;lets you touch its head, closes its eyes, and enjoys the process. Generally, dogs don’t like being patted on&nbsp;the head and some of&nbsp;them may even perceive it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>threat</a>. <strong>So&nbsp;if&nbsp;your dog lets you do&nbsp;this, you are a&nbsp;special one to&nbsp;them.</strong></p><p><h2>10. Calmly watching you leave.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab9/497/1a405159e48a1232c3288e16d1.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your dog feels calm when you leave and waits for you patiently all day, it&nbsp;means that your pet trusts you and it&nbsp;knows for sure that you will come back. But if&nbsp;your <strong>dog feels anxious when you leave</strong>, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;barks or&nbsp;chews and scratches things, there are <a href=#>ways</a> to&nbsp;make separation less stressful for your pet.</p><p><h2>11. Going crazy when you come back!</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2bf/47d/aa6ae55d3c9e8b091762c30e0f.jpg><p>Does your dog freak out when it&nbsp;sees you come back after a&nbsp;long day at&nbsp;work? This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most vivid signs of&nbsp;love and affection. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Experiments</a> have shown that the <strong>reunion with their beloved human has an&nbsp;extremely positive effect on&nbsp;dogs</strong>, increasing their level of&nbsp;oxytocin, the social hormone, and lowering the level of&nbsp;cortisol, the stress hormone. So, seeing their owner finally come back makes the dog feel happy and safe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/293/aed/8fd4675e78be5ffdf6892717b4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this article we&nbsp;have told you about the most common ways in&nbsp;which dogs demonstrate their love, but dogs, like humans, are very different. Take a&nbsp;closer look at&nbsp;your pet’s behavior and maybe you will spot the unique way that your dog says “I&nbsp;love you!”</p><p>Which of&nbsp;the points surprised you the most? Do&nbsp;you have pets? Do&nbsp;they show you their love in&nbsp;any special way?
