And some of&nbsp;them have been together for so&nbsp;long, you might have forgotten that they met on&nbsp;set.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>believes that you can meet your soulmate anywhere and that making your love last is&nbsp;entirely possible. Let’s admire these cute couples together.</p><p><h2>1. Josh Dallas and Ginnifer Goodwin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/50a/952/3c07c05c11bc0acbc8fa033ec7.jpg><p>Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas were cast as&nbsp;Snow White and Prince Charming for the show <i>Once Upon a&nbsp;Time</i>, and their fairytale romance <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grew into a&nbsp;real one</a>. The couple got engaged in&nbsp;2013 and got married in&nbsp;2014. They have 2&nbsp;sons together.</p><p><h2>2. Peter Krause and Lauren Graham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/92e/e3f/6566145c2eab2500b0940db0a0.jpg><p>These 2&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>knew</a> each other years before starring together on&nbsp;the show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Parenthood</i></a>, but they didn’t get together until they became co-stars. They started dating in&nbsp;2010, and have kept their romance very private since. The couple is&nbsp;still going strong after nearly 12&nbsp;years together.</p><p><h2>3. Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68d/1b4/08bfe051958d05accf8f50962c.jpg><p>The pair met on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Midnight in&nbsp;the Switchgrass</i></a> in&nbsp;2020 and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started off as&nbsp;friends</a>, as&nbsp;Fox was still married at&nbsp;that time. Her separation from her then-husband Brian Austin Green caused the rumors that she and Machine Gun Kelly were more than just friends. Their relationship got confirmed a&nbsp;short while later, and the couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> their engagement in&nbsp;January 2022.</p><p><h2>4. Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78e/4fc/dca8115fa49760bd03113748e6.jpg><p>The couple originally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the horror movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>I&nbsp;Know What You Did Last Summer</i></a>, and had to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time together off set, as&nbsp;Sarah Michelle Gellar didn’t have a&nbsp;driver’s license, so&nbsp;Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr. helped her out by&nbsp;giving her rides to&nbsp;and from the filming site. They became friends, but then started dating when they filmed their next project together&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Scooby-Doo</i></a><i>, </i>which came out in&nbsp;2002. The couple tied the knot that same year.</p><p><h2>5. Eliza Taylor and Bob Morley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/481/88a/64b37d559b9e65b1d1b56d3e80.jpg><p>They started off as&nbsp;co-stars on&nbsp;the series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The 100</i></a>, but at&nbsp;some point, their friendship grew into something more. However, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;announce their relationship only after they got married in&nbsp;2019, to&nbsp;their fans’ surprise. In&nbsp;February 2022, the couple announced that they are expecting their first child.</p><p><h2>6. Stephen Moyer and Anna Paquin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64d/8a0/4e00845211a64f5e9dda520541.jpg><p>These 2&nbsp;are another example of&nbsp;an&nbsp;on-screen romance <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>growing</a> into real-life: Moyer played Paquin’s love interest in&nbsp;the series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>True Blood</i></a>, and the sparks between them began during the audition! Stephen Moyer recalled that he&nbsp;knew he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;spend the rest of&nbsp;his life with Anna Paquin even when they didn’t know each other very well, and he&nbsp;was right: the couple wed in&nbsp;2010 and now have 2&nbsp;kids together.</p><p><h2>7. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c42/e02/745fa652578ff2e628bdbfd460.jpg><p>Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>knew each other</a> for a&nbsp;while before they starred together in&nbsp;the movie <i>Dream House</i> in&nbsp;2010, but the sparks flew on&nbsp;set.

Grace Gealey and Trai Byers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/104/0e9/7374f65e39bc2dba32c34a1df6.jpg><p>The pair met on&nbsp;set of&nbsp;the series <i>Empire</i>, and it&nbsp;might have been the case of&nbsp;love at&nbsp;first sight, as&nbsp;they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>got engaged</a> the same year the show premiered&nbsp;— in&nbsp;2015. They got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> a&nbsp;year later in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private ceremony.</p><p><h2>9.

The couple wants to&nbsp;marry in&nbsp;the near future, but has not found the time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;yet.</p><p><h2>10. Tuc Watkins and Andrew Rannells</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14b/40a/5eb2e25b879f32bb621d8d47ca.jpg><p>The pair filmed the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Boys in&nbsp;the Band</i></a> together and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> dating shortly after. Rannells recalled that when he&nbsp;did not know Watkins super well, the thought that they would end up&nbsp;having a ’showmance’ popped up&nbsp;in&nbsp;his head&nbsp;— and he&nbsp;was right.&nbsp;3&nbsp;years later, this couple is&nbsp;still together.</p><p><h2>11. Rami Malek and Lucy Boynton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd5/c12/2832d6535cbf00496a067e5d7f.jpg><p>Filming the Oscar-winning movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brought</a> these 2&nbsp;together, and they are still going strong to&nbsp;this day. Aside from appearing on&nbsp;red carpets together, they keep their relationship private.
