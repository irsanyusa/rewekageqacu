Travis Japan</h2><p>Travis Japan is a J-pop seven member boy band. Their act combines vocals with high-energy dance moves. Following their AGT audition, Simon Cowell stated that their “energy was through the roof.” They continued on in the competition, but was eliminated after their semifinal performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. MPLUSPLUS</h2><p>MPLUSPLUS graced the AGT stage in season 17 as a group of engineers and performers that prepared for 12 years for their audition. Their audition made it clear that they have years of experience behind them. Unfortunately, MPLUSPLUS did not get enough votes in the semifinals eliminating the group from the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReAusknSMms</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Kenichi Ebina</h2><p>AGT season eight winner Kenichi Ebina has to be one of the most memorable Japanese acts to grace the stage. He is a self-taught dance performer that consists of freestyle Hip-hop&nbsp;with the occasional matrix-inspired dance moves.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Yumbo Dump</h2><p>Now, this is a comedic duo that showcases an unusual but unique talent. Yumbo Dump’s acts consisted of making various sounds using their bodies such as cries of dolphins, and the sound of a UFO flying. The nature of their act requiring them to be topless makes them quite unusual to some viewers and judges. This was evidenced by their reactions, as well as receiving red buzzers for their performances.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-fusion-japan>5. Fusion Japan</h2><p>Fusion Japan is a Japanese supergroup combining two rival dance groups: Kyushu Danji and Fabulous Sisters. Their dance routine includes synchronized dance moves from the girls and acrobatics for the boys. The supergroup delivers some of the most entertaining acts of the show. Mainly because of the number of performers and the skill it takes to choreograph their dance steps almost perfectly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. UniCircle Flow</h2><p>UniCircle Flow is a unicycle dance performance group from Japan, they competed in the 16th season of AGT. Their performance includes high-paced original dance moves that are in sync and choreographed to perfection. Cowell even said their act is “one of the most unique, amazing acts we’ve seen on AGT over the years.” Their group made it up to the semifinals of the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Waffle</h2><p>Hailing from Tokyo, Japan, Waffle is a World Double Dutch Contest champion group. The group flew all the way from home to deliver an amazing double dutch jump rope audition on AGT. Doing their act to the tune of “Let’s Groove” by Earth, Wind & Fire, makes their performance very memorable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-pU6v66VNM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-gonzo>8. Gonzo</h2><p>This performer is not just a tambourinist from Japan, he is also an entertainer that loves putting smiles on everyone’s faces with his performances. Gonzo performs all over the world doing what he loves, and we commend him for it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Blue Tokyo</h2><p>Blue Tokyo already left an impression by showing up with an injured member due to practicing for their audition. Despite this, they truly made a mark by dancing so in sync with each other. You can see the amount of effort it takes to perform a dance act as well as Blue Tokyo did. They have separated themselves from other dance groups in the show by upping their acrobatics to the next level.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Shu Takada</h2><p>Shu Takada is a Yo-Yo champion from season 17 of AGT. He is possibly the greatest Yo-Yo act that has ever been on AGT and with good reason. Takada has a background of being a six-time World Yo-Yo Champion. It is no surprise that he’s the one that delivered the Yo-Yo act that was not “boring,” as Cowell said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz214PN7bsE</p></figure><p>Many talented people from all over the world go to <a href=#>AGT</a> to showcase their skills.
