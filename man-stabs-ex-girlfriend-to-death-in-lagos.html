She wrote: "On July 10, 2024, my younger sister Opeyemi went clubbing at Bells Bar Itamaga along Ijede, Elepe, Ikorodu. She met her ex-boyfriend there, and they went chilling together. At around 5 am, they got into a fight, and her ex-boyfriend Fatai Mogaji stabbed her multiple times. He stabbed her 22 times, including her eyes. He wrapped her with his bedsheet, put her in the kitchen, and locked the door. He killed her and wrapped her in the kitchen, then locked the door. He was planning to come back to clean up. The landlord called the police. Please help me find this guy, Fatai."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The post caught the attention of the Police Force spokesperson, <strong>ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi,</strong> who ordered an immediate investigation.</p><p>"This is callous. Swing into action immediately and ensure the culprit is apprehended," he tweeted.</p><p>The sister of the deceased also made an appeal for justice, stating, "Please we want her to be buried and her killer to face the wrath of the law. Please, friends, help me repost till it gets to the right table. My family does not have money; even his being caught was by the grace of God and the blood of my sister."</p><p>Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), <strong>Benjamin Hundeyin </strong>confirmed the development, stating that the suspect is now cooling off in custody.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHyurc1mqq2Zkqh6psSMoKCrpJantqa6w2arqGWUmq61tIyipWakkZy8tHuPcqKqqqCm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
