Kemi Badenoch comes a distant second at 15%, followed by Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss on 13% each.</p><p>On this question, Mordaunt is the favoured candidate among members who voted Leave in 2016 (29%), and the second favourite among those who voted Remain (20%, to Rishi Sunak’s 25%).</p><p>Pairing off the candidates in head to head contests – <a href=#>as will happen at the final members’ vote</a> – shows Mordaunt beating all comers.</p><p>Her closest competitor is Liz Truss, who she nevertheless convincingly beats by 55% to 37%. She likewise firmly sees off Kemi Badenoch by 59% to 30%, and Rishi Sunak by 67% to 28%.</p><p>Mordaunt takes the majority of the Leave vote in all of her head to heads, and either takes the Remain vote too, or closely splits it (she takes 44% against Sunak’s 50%, and 45% to Tugendhat’s 47%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Con20members20head20to20heads20poll202.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While Rishi Sunak <a href=#>appears to have the most support among Tory MPs at the nominations stage</a>, he performs poorly in the head to heads.</p><p>The only candidate the former chancellor definitely seems to be beating at this stage is Jeremy Hunt, by 57% to 25%. He is effectively tied (within the margin of error) against Suella Braverman (his 45% to her 42%) and Nadhim Zahawi (both 41%).</p><p>Sunak loses to Badenoch, Tugendhat, Truss, and the aforementioned Mordaunt, the latter two by very wide margins.</p><p>Additional head to head matchups show Liz Truss convincingly beating both Tom Tugendhat (by 57% to 36%) and Kemi Badenoch (by 54% to 37%). In a Tugendhat vs Badenoch face-off, there is an effective tie, with the former on 42% and the latter on 44%.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGh%2Bc4SMqZynpqliurC%2Bw5qsp6xdmLmmrdFmnZqun6q%2FqsDEZqWesKRisLC60p6pr5mknsOmecs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
