He particularly pays attention to every detail, the pores, nostril hair, the bead of sweat, eyelid wrinkle, hair and others, producing images that seem to capture more detail than our very own eyes and that's what makes his painting so hyper-realistic.</p><p>Asides from his drawing and painting that we're familiar with, let's get to know a little bit more about the artist. Here are 5 things you should know about Arinze Stanley.</p><p>1. He started his profession without any training.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Stanley, who had been drawing ever since he was a kid, decided to take drawing professionally in 2012 without going for any training whatsoever.</p><p>2. Arinze uses only pencils for his drawings</p><p>Achieving these beautiful 3D artworks, the artist uses only pencils, charcoal and graphite pencils. One would expect that with the paintings looking so real and precise, there just might be some additional and unknown mediums involved in his art. Sorry to burst your bubbles, it's simply pencils.</p><p>3. He gets inspired by anything</p><p>Stanley's pieces are inspired by anything at all as long as he has an emotional connection with whatever it is. Some of his most cherished works so far include the painting of Nigeria President, <strong>Buhari</strong>, his mother, one of his favourite celebrities, <strong>Juliet Ibrahim</strong> and a couple others.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>4. Stanley is a business man</p><p>The artist, who studied Engineering at the University of Ilorin but recently chose drawing as a career choice, works with his father in a family business. So, not only does Stanley draw, he handles business as well and he has managed to combine both well during the course of the years.</p><p>5. It takes over 200 hours for the artist to get a painting done.</p><p>Wow! That's a whole lot of work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cK3RoqWznV2owaK6y56wZqCVp7JurdGeZG5lmaPBpr7ErKuippdiwam1zaCqZrGfqnq0tM6uo51lm6O8uHnAm6aurF2ptaq%2FjKegoJ2inq6ve5Clq6Wfqqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
