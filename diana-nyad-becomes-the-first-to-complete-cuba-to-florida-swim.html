Fans circled her as she approached the shore —&nbsp;some in boats who’d waited to greet her — and Nyad was hard to spot at times in the gathering of people around her.</p><p>“I got three messages,” Nyad <a href=#>told</a> reporters.&nbsp;“One is we should never ever give up. Two is you never are too old to chase your dreams. Three is it looks like a solitary sport, but it’s a team.”</p><p>With 17 miles still to go, Nyad already <a href=#>broke the world record</a> for longest-distance swim, previously held by Penny Palfrey for her 2012 slog over the same stretch of water.</p><p>Nyad swam without the protection of a shark cage or a wet suit, though she did strap on a prosthetic face mask to shield her from jellyfish stings.</p><p>Her support team wrote on the swimmer’s website that she still had&nbsp;to contend with “currents, shipping lanes, reefs and swarms of jellyfish.” They also stated that the site,&nbsp;<a href=#>diananyad.com</a>, was at one point getting&nbsp;18,000 visits per second as she neared the end of her swim.</p><p>President Barack Obama congratulated Nyad on Twitter:</p><p>Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton weighed in on the shark situation:</p><p>Flying to 112 countries is a lot until you consider swimming between 2. Feels like I swim with sharks – but you actually did it! Congrats!</p><p>— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) <a href=#>September 2, 2013</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijlZq9qrrGrJqoqpVjr627xqxlraGdmnuku8xoaWlpY2R9enuPa2adoZGjrm662JqbZpqVmLyusdJmq6GdXZu2s7%2FTZquoZZOkurG4xK2cZpull65uwM5mnaWnop6xonnSsKCmZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
