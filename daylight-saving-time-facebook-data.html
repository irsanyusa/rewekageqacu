The Monday morning after the clocks sprung forward for Daylight Saving last week, Americans were feeling sleepy. Rather than take that statement at face value, the data scientists at Facebook decided to find out just how sleepy people were. (In non-scientific terms: They could have used an extra hour of shut eye).
Researchers worked with Facebook Data Science to create graphs out of anonymized, aggregated data that chronicled people’s sleepy scale."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The graph below shows that users adding “feeling tired” to their Facebook status was up a total of 25% from the prior Monday and a whopping 86% between the hours of 5am to 12pm. Not shown is that “sleepy” was up 28% and “exhausted” was up 20%. People wanted a nap!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-14-at-5-36-14-pm.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But some states were dealing with their sleep deprivation better than others. The map below shows how different geographic regions reacted to Daylight Saving on Facebook — the darker the blue, the larger the “feeling tired” status increase.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/map1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Arizona, which doesn’t practice in the cult of Daylight Saving, didn’t feel sleepier than usual. The darkest blue is in the middle of the country, Florida, and in the North East. According to Facebook, Delaware was the tiredest state of them all. “Feeling tired” statuses increased by 231%.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Luckily by Tuesday, tired statuses were down 6.5% and by Thursday, it was as if nothing happened.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But not everyone was a spoilsport. Facebook says that while some people complained about being tired, positive reactions to Daylight Saving were up, too. There was a 21% increase of using the word “wonderful” and 19% increase of the word “great.” Annoyed was down 14%.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Morning people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZrb2NthXCwwLKjop%2BYqXq0rdWipaBlpJ66pnnFmpqemp%2BkuG6wwK2YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
