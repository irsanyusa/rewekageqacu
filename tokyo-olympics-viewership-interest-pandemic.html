In a Morning Consult poll conducted March 16-22, 36 percent of U.S. adults were aware that the next Olympics are scheduled to be held this summer, while 40 percent of Americans correctly identified Tokyo as the host city."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With that milestone for this summer’s Tokyo Games just two weeks away, expert analysis of new Morning Consult data indicates the U.S. Olympic broadcaster is starting from a fairly strong position.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In a Morning Consult <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>poll</a> conducted March 16-22, 36 percent of U.S. adults were aware that the next Olympics are scheduled to be held this summer, while 40 percent of Americans correctly identified Tokyo as the host city. Joe Brown, a former researcher for the Comcast Inc.-owned media group who now runs JWB3 Media Insights, said awareness of the “when” and “where” of this summer’s games is “relatively positive” compared to this point in past Olympic cycles.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Typically, we’d be saying we’re four months out, but the reality is we’re eight months behind when it should have been,” Brown said, acknowledging last summer’s postponement due to the pandemic likely put the games on Americans’ radar. “It’s very unique that you’re building the second awareness cycle.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Normally, Brown said he would expect those awareness figures to jump up to between 60 and 70 percent in the three weeks leading up to the games.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Another indicator NBC researchers will have their eye on over the next few months is viewership intent. In Morning Consult’s survey, 61 percent of U.S. adults said they expect to watch “a lot” or “some” of the Tokyo Games, assuming they are held as planned from July 23-Aug. 8. Among sports fans, 73 percent said they plan to watch at least a portion of the games.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Looking at prior research, that’s a little better than Rio at this point,” Brown said. “And I think that’s about interest in Tokyo as a host city. Intent typically follows interest in the host city. You saw it peak for London, and when we get to LA in ‘28, it’ll be incredibly high.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While Brown believes both awareness and intent are in a good place with just under four months until the Tokyo Games, he sees a few potential causes for concern as it pertains to viewership for the Olympics this summer.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">First, roughly 1 in 3 U.S. adults indicated in the survey that they still believe the games should be either postponed again or canceled. Historically speaking, that’s a red flag.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While there is also a significant 13-hour time difference between New York and Tokyo, many key events like swimming and track are scheduled to be held in the morning in Japan, meaning they can be shown live in U.S. primetime.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In addition to the “controversy” factor, Brown suggested the success of nationwide vaccination efforts after a yearlong lockdown could lead to more days and nights out, and, as a result, less time spent in front of the TV.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“As people get vaccinated, they’re going to want to do the things they haven't been able to do for the past year,” he said. “What they have been for the past year is stuck inside watching TV. This summer, they’re going to want to go to concerts, they’re going to want to go to restaurants, they’re going to want to go back out to sporting events.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Tokyo Games could also suffer from a lack of star power, most notably due to the retirements of American swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. Of the 15 American athletes included in the Morning Consult survey, only tennis star Serena Williams and decorated gymnast Simone Biles were known by more than half of U.S. adults.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Given the pandemic-related uncertainty, lack of popular personalities and the decline in traditional television viewership in recent years, Brown said there is potential for the Tokyo Games to be “NBC’s lowest-rated Summer Olympics.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As for which events might generate the most interest in Tokyo, the usual Summer Games favorites of gymnastics and swimming seem likely to lead the way. Seventy percent of U.S. adults said they would be either “very” or “somewhat” interested in watching gymnastics, while 62 percent expressed interest in watching swimming at the Olympics.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Diving (54 percent), beach volleyball (54 percent), track and field (52 percent), basketball (52 percent) and indoor volleyball (51 percent) were the only other sports that appealed to more than half of respondents. Brown noted a medal run by the U.S. women’s national soccer team would also be a boon for NBC.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Among the five new sports for Tokyo, baseball/softball (48 percent) and surfing (47 percent) generated the most interest among survey respondents, followed by karate (45 percent) skateboarding (43 percent) and sport climbing (34 percent).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6m8rMXOZqalsZ2ltqS%2FjK%2Bgnq%2BVp8Cptc9moKeslaeytMCMqZinnJWitqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
