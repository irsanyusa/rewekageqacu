I was curious to see if the store would have any kind of tribute displayed for the late fashion icon and to get a sense of how the store felt in person.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Overall, the stores variety of high-end products and thoughtful layout contributed to its overall feel of luxury. I found that inventory was displayed, not just as products for browsing, but rather as pieces of art.</p><p>Here's what the SoHo Chanel store looks like.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=a9096bbf-3e55-3e9e-afac-acfe9a3bb934>Meet Virginie Viard, the designer taking Karl Lagerfeld's place at Chanel who has been by his side since she was an intern there</span></strong></p><p><strong>NOW READ: <span id=646c3822-b195-3273-a83d-3fecc5d9c310>Karl Lagerfeld owned more than 1,000 of his iconic high-collared shirts, and he helped design them himself</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8hmraKrmamypXnToZxmm5iWu6a4jKyrqKqVYravedKon6hlpJ2ybrDAsmSanqSav263wKujZqSRnLKzssSlm2acmZqxbq3NnWSirF2srrR5wqWcmqpfpYSpgsSzbw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
