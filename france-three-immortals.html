The latter’s political biography of ex-Premier Georges Clemenceau is said to be the best of its kind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1629, Valentin Conrart, secretary to Louis XIII, received each week in his house eight of the literary lights of the period. It was not long before Cardinal Richelieu heard of the meetings and, wishing to control the litterateurs as he controlled everybody else, he offered his protection and promised a royal charter to the society. Most of the habitués of Conrart’s garret would have preferred to remain free; but it was dangerous to oppose the Cardinal, so they reluctantly were forced to accept the offer of His Eminence. In 1635, letters patent were granted by the King, and the Académie Française came into being.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The object of the Academy, according to Article 24 of its charter, is stated thus: “The principal function of the Academy shall be to labor with all care and diligence and give certain rules to our language, and to render it pure, eloquent and capable of treating the Arts and Sciences.” And, in the famed Letter of the Academy to Cardinal Richelieu, the members proposed “to cleanse the language from the impurities it has contracted in the mouths of the common people, from the jargon of the lawyers, from the misusages of ignorant courtiers and the abuses of the pulpit.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1793, the Academy perished, like the other academies of the ancien régime, in the Revolution. In 1795, the Convention stated that “there is, for all the Republic, but one National Institute, designed to gather discoveries and to perfect the Arts and the Sciences.” From 1796 on, the Academy became a part of the Institut de France—the most important part. It was still confined to 40 members, called Immortals, and continued to be the guardian of the French language designed to encourage Literature and foster genius. In every other respect, it was changed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, including the above elections, there are 37 members, among the most important of whom are: Litterateurs: Joseph Bédier, Paul Bourget, Marcel Prevost, Henri de Regnier; Statesmen: Louis Barthou, Georges Clemenceau, Raymond Poincaré, Jules Cambon; Soldiers: Les Maréchals Ferdinand Foch, Joseph Joffre, Louis Lyautey; Artists: Albert Besnard (the only one) ; Journalist: Georges Lecomte; Educator: Emile Picard.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">*Three seats are still vacant—those of Anatole France, Maurice Barrés, Comte d’Haussonville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tbmpoZX9wstGapZydXam1s7HEZqCmpZ%2BnwaK40mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
