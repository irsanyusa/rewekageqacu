Here’s what we’ve learned about the 5-decade-long brotherhood of&nbsp;Al&nbsp;Pacino and Robert De&nbsp;Niro.</p><p><h2>They have so&nbsp;much in&nbsp;common.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/832/ca8/e90fc75901aca2a8990d522d3d.jpg><p>Both Pacino and De&nbsp;Niro <a href=#>grew</a> up&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a> in&nbsp;the 1940s. They <a href=#>were</a> both children of&nbsp;divorced parents, and they both <a href=#>attended</a> acting school, and both <a href=#>admired</a> the same talented actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean. Later&nbsp;on, they both started their acting careers with big roles in&nbsp;“gangster” movies: one of&nbsp;Pacino’s first roles was the <a href=#>role</a> of&nbsp;Michael Corleone in&nbsp;The Godfather (1972), while Robert De&nbsp;Niro <a href=#>played</a> John “Johnny Boy” Civello in&nbsp;Mean Streets (1973).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ac/7bd/da9cb8567a835ba3f993f768e4.jpg><p>When the 2&nbsp;<a href=#>met</a> back at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1960s in&nbsp;New York, they were both young rookie actors who had just started their careers. The magic between the 2&nbsp;actors on&nbsp;screen is&nbsp;so&nbsp;intense, and their roles are so&nbsp;remarkable, that it&nbsp;may seem that we’ve seen them acting together in&nbsp;a&nbsp;multitude of&nbsp;films. In&nbsp;reality, The Irishman (2019) <a href=#>is</a>&nbsp;only the 4th movie that starred Pacino and De&nbsp;Niro together, the other 3&nbsp;being Heat (1995), Righteous Kill (2008) and The Godfather Part II&nbsp;(1974) where they didn’t even have common scenes.</p><p><h2>They always have each other’s back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c70/deb/a7067a52d7a566912a2e781037.jpg><p>When the 2&nbsp;actors became famous after starring in&nbsp;big movies, they actually <a href=#>faced</a> their sudden fame together, during the same period of&nbsp;time. Back then, their friendship <a href=#>helped</a> them to&nbsp;stand the test of&nbsp;glory.</p><p>“We&nbsp;were in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unusual position,” <a href=#>said</a> Pacino in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their interviews. “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;whole different idea, being well-known. Not quite the way it&nbsp;is&nbsp;now. It&nbsp;was not as&nbsp;accessible, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;famous.”</p><p>De&nbsp;Niro <a href=#>agreed</a>: “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good thing that we&nbsp;had each other to&nbsp;talk about stuff.”</p><p>The 2&nbsp;still help and support each other and they <a href=#>understand</a> one another very well. “We&nbsp;get together. And there’s a&nbsp;trust there. There just&nbsp;is. We&nbsp;understand this thing together a&nbsp;little bit better. And you go&nbsp;there sometimes just to&nbsp;get some feedback. We&nbsp;talk about things,” <a href=#>says</a> Pacino.</p><p><h2>There’s no&nbsp;rivalry between them, even though they were often up&nbsp;for the same roles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0cc/f69/249ddd54328f657495ccd449eb.jpg><p>During the 50-year-long friendship between Pacino and De&nbsp;Niro, there <a href=#>were</a> situations where they both were up&nbsp;for the same roles, like that of&nbsp;Michael Corleone in&nbsp;The Godfather. But it&nbsp;never turned the 2&nbsp;friends into enemies.</p><p>“You’re not competitive. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;person gets a&nbsp;part and they’re great in&nbsp;it, that’s fine. It’s when an&nbsp;actor is&nbsp;not good for it&nbsp;and they’re chosen for the wrong reasons, then you are regretful and not even jealous. You say, well, O.K., there you&nbsp;go. That’s just what it&nbsp;is,” <a href=#>says</a> De&nbsp;Niro.</p><p><h2>They teach and learn from each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a6/92e/b5ed7c5c95aa23186c4d675c14.jpg><p>When you are close with a&nbsp;person and the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;you trust each other and respect each other’s talents, there’s no&nbsp;way you can escape learning things from one another. This is&nbsp;also true for Pacino and De&nbsp;Niro. For example, in&nbsp;one interview De&nbsp;Niro <a href=#>confessed</a> that it&nbsp;was&nbsp;Al who taught him to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;reading of&nbsp;the role with the director and other actors before the actual shooting, to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;better understanding of&nbsp;the material.</p><p><h2>They praise each other’s talent and are not shy to&nbsp;say, “I&nbsp;love you.”</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you read or&nbsp;watch interviews with Pacino and De&nbsp;Niro, you’ll probably pay attention to&nbsp;how many kind words they use when speaking about one another. They compliment each other on&nbsp;their talent and approach to&nbsp;work, they <a href=#>say</a> how much their friendship means to&nbsp;them, they even recall their first impressions of&nbsp;one another, and they also turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very touching and kind:</p><p>“I&nbsp;remember the meeting very clearly. Unbelievably, I&nbsp;saw this guy, I&nbsp;thought, ‘Wow,’ he’s got such charisma. He&nbsp;wasn’t doing anything. He&nbsp;was just walking. [...] You know, he&nbsp;was Bob. But you felt something from him,” says Pacino as&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href=#>recollects</a> the first time he&nbsp;met De&nbsp;Niro.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f5f/f7f/7bb1f75cd5b9f4d115addbf1ce.jpg><p>During their joint interviews, Pacino and De&nbsp;Niro often <a href=#>answer</a> questions for each other, play jokes on&nbsp;each other, and are not shy about showing their true feelings&nbsp;— they laugh, embrace, and <a href=#>say</a>, “I&nbsp;love you.”</p><p>The friendship between our 2&nbsp;favorite actors has lasted for more than 50&nbsp;years, and these handsome men can surely teach&nbsp;us a&nbsp;lot about being a&nbsp;faithful friend. We&nbsp;hope Al&nbsp;Pacino and Robert De&nbsp;Niro will sustain their bond forever and we’re keeping our fingers crossed that we’ll see them together again in&nbsp;many more fascinating movies.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;friend who’s been together with you for decades?
