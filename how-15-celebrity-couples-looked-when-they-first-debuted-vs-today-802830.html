We’d <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for you to&nbsp;witness the never-fading love together with&nbsp;us.</p><p><h2>1. Victoria and David Beckham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/898/506/132f105da29172d5b5f7c1e3ff.jpg><p>Victoria and <a href=# title="David Beckham" data-link=tag>David Beckham</a> had been dating for a&nbsp;year before they made their big reveal at&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>press conference</a> in&nbsp;1998. Their romance is&nbsp;probably worth being recorded in&nbsp;<a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a> books, and their happy marriage has lasted for over <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>20</a>&nbsp;years now.</p><p><h2>2. Kate Middleton and Prince William</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/878/39b/61a2215683bae2b9ab777678fa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;April 2021, <a href=# title="Kate Middleton" data-link=tag>Kate Middleton</a> and <a href=# title="Prince William" data-link=tag>Prince William</a> celebrated <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>10</a>&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage. The relationship between the heir to&nbsp;the throne and the Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>always</a> been followed closely by&nbsp;journalists and royal observers. This publicity might have been extremely difficult for any other relationship, but it&nbsp;seems they’ve been successful at&nbsp;coping with the public pressure by&nbsp;leaning on&nbsp;each other and trying to&nbsp;live as&nbsp;privately as&nbsp;possible.</p><p><h2>3. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88e/725/a50fb8562f807dbc6e2ab2f29f.jpg><p>This couple has been going strong since they first met in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>1966</a> and began dating in&nbsp;1983. The duo has never been married, but in&nbsp;numerous interviews, they’ve <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>confessed</a> that they’re happy together and don’t care that much about official wedding procedures.</p><p><h2>4. Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01c/f11/46625559a99867ca5fa2913a7e.jpg><p>The love story of&nbsp;Blake and Ryan began on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<i>Green Lantern</i> in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2010</a>. In&nbsp;July of&nbsp;the same year, they first appeared together in&nbsp;public and provoked a&nbsp;huge stir among fans. At&nbsp;that time, they both were dating other people. In&nbsp;September <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2012</a> the couple got married secretly in&nbsp;South Carolina and since then, their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> has only grown bigger and stronger.</p><p><h2>5. Meryl Streep and Don Gummer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/63f/2e7/87a2d657a399134a8028d276c3.jpg><p>Don Gummer has stood by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Meryl Streep" data-link=tag>Meryl Streep</a>’s side for over <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>4&nbsp;decades</a>. They first met in&nbsp;1978, when Streep was mourning the death of&nbsp;her then-boyfriend, John Cazale, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>died</a> of&nbsp;lung cancer. Later, in&nbsp;the same year, the couple got married in&nbsp;the garden of&nbsp;her parents’ home, and they’ve never parted since.</p><p><h2>6. Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/150/e50/daca86582a8f12473ba2d22076.jpg><p>The couple first met in&nbsp;2014&nbsp;on the set of&nbsp;the show, <i>The Voice. </i>In&nbsp;2015, their romance officially started<i>, </i>however, to&nbsp;many people, they seemed like an&nbsp;odd pair. They became not only romantic partners, but musical ones as&nbsp;well, and they even recorded a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>song</a>, “Go&nbsp;Ahead and Break My&nbsp;Heart.”<i> </i>In&nbsp;July 2021, they finally <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>made</a> their relationship official by&nbsp;getting married, and their family is&nbsp;pretty big and includes <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>3</a>&nbsp;sons from Gwen’s previous marriage, and they all seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy and enjoying life together.</p><p><h2>7. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e9/3ab/3a197b5996b81886c3ed25179f.jpg><p>Life and destiny can play tricks on&nbsp;us and be&nbsp;unpredictable at&nbsp;times, but something everyone can rely on&nbsp;is&nbsp;Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar’s love. Their love story started in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>1997</a>&nbsp;on the set of&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;Know What You Did Last Summer. </i>They got married in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2002</a> and have since been a&nbsp;model to&nbsp;follow for people who appreciate traditional family values and believe in&nbsp;true love at&nbsp;first sight.</p><p><h2>8. Salma Hayek and François-Henri Pinault</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/622/73c/9b32df5b258f04bcde7e7d58e9.jpg><p>Actress <a href=# title="Salma Hayek" data-link=tag>Salma Hayek</a> and the CEO of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big fashion house, Pinault, have been married since <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2009</a>. Salma’s fans used to&nbsp;think that she married Pinault because of&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>wealth</a> and status, but as&nbsp;she has confessed in&nbsp;numerous interviews before she was attracted to&nbsp;him, she didn’t know who he&nbsp;was or&nbsp;how much money he&nbsp;had. They have a&nbsp;common daughter and are never tired of&nbsp;saying that their marriage is&nbsp;something that makes them both better people.</p><p><h2>9. Justin and Hailey Bieber</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/393/105/c8e1d15ce7bbdcf710979385ee.jpg><p>Justin and Hailey have been married since 2018, and their first meeting was quite <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>awkward</a>, as&nbsp;Hailey hardly even cracked a&nbsp;smile when she was introduced to&nbsp;Justin. They have a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;an&nbsp;age gap between them, and their relationship hasn’t always been <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>stable</a>, as&nbsp;they’ve parted and then reunited in&nbsp;the past. But now they are happily married, and Justin never grows tired of&nbsp;expressing his love for his better half in&nbsp;any possible style and manner, showing fans a&nbsp;good example of&nbsp;what love and commitment are.</p><p><h2>10. Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e8d/f0c/5f93d0521b9ad518539e831e6c.jpg><p>This <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>23-year-old</a> relationship between a&nbsp;supermodel and a&nbsp;nightlife industry magnate started when Cindy was still married to&nbsp;her first husband, Richard Gere. The couple first met at&nbsp;Cindy’s agent’s wedding where they were invited with Rande’s girlfriend and Cindy’s husband, but Cindy came there alone. They liked each other at&nbsp;first sight, but only after Cindy parted with Richard Gere did she start dating Rande. Today, their marriage is&nbsp;crowned by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2</a>&nbsp;kids and is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;mutual respect and support.</p><p><h2>11. Pierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c6/8e9/f175405123937f7c66a57644a2.jpg><p><a href=# title="Pierce Brosnan" data-link=tag>Pierce Brosnan</a> is&nbsp;not only the ex-James Bond and the symbol of&nbsp;masculinity to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;women, but he’s also a&nbsp;devoted husband and father together with his wife, Keely. The 2&nbsp;have been together since they first met in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>1994</a> by&nbsp;chance. Pierce is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sure</a> that his wife is&nbsp;the most decent woman on&nbsp;Earth, and Keely often says that her husband is&nbsp;a&nbsp;handsome man who is&nbsp;aging gracefully.</p><p><h2>12. Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de&nbsp;Rossi</h2></p><p>This couple was able to&nbsp;break all possible barriers and got married in&nbsp;August <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2008</a>. They met in&nbsp;2000, but their relationship started only in&nbsp;2004, and this gave de&nbsp;Rossi all the necessary <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>confidence</a> to&nbsp;come out as&nbsp;gay. In&nbsp;their interviews, the couple never grows tired of&nbsp;repeating that they, above all, are friends in&nbsp;their relationship, which means standing by&nbsp;one another’s side and doing lovely things together, like rescuing abandoned puppies or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>helping</a> each other survive through toxic working relationships.</p><p><h2>13. Beyoncé and Jay-Z</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c62/ed7/572c275dbcbf97d1f8e75b54dd.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d5/36b/859e795c06a25f50fef5b4fbc2.jpg><p>This couple is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most well-known duos in&nbsp;the world. They met in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2000</a> and started dating in&nbsp;2001. Their secret wedding in&nbsp;2008 marked the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;family that is&nbsp;still as&nbsp;solid as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock. They have 3&nbsp;children together and their marriage has continued to&nbsp;stay strong over the years.</p><p><h2>14. Chrissy Teigen and John Legend</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d59/846/b8a3885f4d8294fdff88f8d472.jpg><p>The couple first met in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2006</a>&nbsp;on the set of&nbsp;a&nbsp;music video for the song, <i>Stereo</i>. As&nbsp;Chrissy has often <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;her interviews, marriage was never her goal, she just felt that John was her man without all the officialities. They tied the knot in&nbsp;2013 and later made their union even stronger by&nbsp;welcoming 2&nbsp;kids to&nbsp;the family. Legend claims that the keystone in&nbsp;the fortress of&nbsp;their relationship is&nbsp;the genuine sense of&nbsp;humor that Chrissy has. “She makes me&nbsp;laugh all the time”, he&nbsp;says in&nbsp;his interviews.</p><p><h2>15. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f7/840/47b45c5969ad35fe48ff0e90e5.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most iconic couples in&nbsp;Hollywood just celebrated their twenty-third anniversary in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>2020</a>. Their marriage was full of&nbsp;drama and misunderstanding, but they managed to&nbsp;weather all the storms in&nbsp;their family, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>separation</a> and affair rumors. Will <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>said</a> that their marriage survived through the toughest of&nbsp;times only because they were not afraid of&nbsp;making mistakes, and he&nbsp;adds that they now have unconditional love for each other.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;the photos came as&nbsp;the biggest surprise to&nbsp;you?
