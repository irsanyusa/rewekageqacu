The movie star’s biggest dream
At 29, Sophia Loren was already a movie star, as she’d acted in dozens of Italian movies and even some Hollywood flicks. And she was married to a man she loved with all her heart, producer Carlo Ponti."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And my&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;have children had become an&nbsp;obsession. I&nbsp;simply loved children. On&nbsp;the sets of&nbsp;my&nbsp;movies, I’d befriend the child actors and then stay in&nbsp;touch with them long after shooting had finished,” Loren <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;frog pregnancy test</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/724/b41/0fd402518d9bc6ccde6819fec7.jpg><p>The actress felt she had pregnancy symptoms for the first time when she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>played</a> a&nbsp;mother of&nbsp;7&nbsp;in&nbsp;the comedy, <i>Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</i>. Loren took some tests, but even though they were negative, she still thought she was pregnant.</p><p>To&nbsp;do&nbsp;another <strong>pregnancy test</strong>, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> a&nbsp;supposed expert from Rome. But Loren was shocked when he&nbsp;took a&nbsp;frog out of&nbsp;his briefcase and said, <strong>“If&nbsp;the frog dies, it&nbsp;means you’re pregnant.” </strong>Sophia got rid of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=doctor data-link=tag>doctor</a> and released the poor creature into a&nbsp;pond.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;first attempt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f89/c64/431fd756c8999f32c52d12e27b.jpg><p>“Too bad. For a&nbsp;moment there, I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I was pregnant,” Loren <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> to&nbsp;herself, but incredibly, she really was pregnant. Another doctor confirmed it&nbsp;and told her not to&nbsp;travel by&nbsp;<a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a> to&nbsp;avoid shaking.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had to&nbsp;film a&nbsp;scene in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car in&nbsp;those days. Loren almost fainted after the shoot and was sent to&nbsp;the hospital. There, she found out that she had a&nbsp;miscarriage. “Nurses were insensitive, inhumane, devoid of&nbsp;feeling,” recalled Loren. “<strong>My&nbsp;life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;star felt like nothing compared with the happiness of&nbsp;the new mothers</strong> I’d glimpsed at&nbsp;the hospital.”</p><p><h2>Hoping for a&nbsp;miracle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f8c/a3a/9315465012a990d43b99a47752.png><p>4&nbsp;years later, Sophia got pregnant again. This happened while she was filming the movie, <i>More Than a&nbsp;Miracle</i>. Hoping for the better, the actress canceled all her work commitments. But this didn’t help.</p><p>Soon, she felt something was wrong. “When my&nbsp;pains suddenly stopped at&nbsp;4&nbsp;a.m., I&nbsp;knew it&nbsp;was all over. The doctor was called but took 2&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the hospital,” Sophia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>. “’<strong>Signora,’ he&nbsp;told&nbsp;me, ’you no&nbsp;doubt have excellent hips, and you’re a&nbsp;beautiful woman, but you will never have a&nbsp;child.’</strong>”</p><p>After 2&nbsp;miscarriages, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>felt</a> she was a&nbsp;loser who couldn’t fulfill her <a href=# title=dream data-link=tag>dream</a> of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;mother. Even her husband, Carlo Ponti, became depressed. He&nbsp;could hardly work, talk, or&nbsp;smile.</p><p><h2>Long-awaited sons</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;year after her second miscarriage, Loren got pregnant again, but this time, everything was different. This happened because she managed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;doctor who found the reason why she couldn’t carry a&nbsp;child. He&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;her test results and said confidently, “<strong>There’s nothing wrong&nbsp;— you’re a&nbsp;very normal woman.</strong> We’ll monitor you closely.”</p><p>It&nbsp;turned out that her body didn’t produce <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>enough</a> estrogen. In&nbsp;the following months of&nbsp;her pregnancy, Loren spent time in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel room where she received estrogen injections. “Finally, the day came when&nbsp;I was due to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;C-section. I&nbsp;hadn’t slept a&nbsp;wink the night before; the truth is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I didn’t want my&nbsp;pregnancy to&nbsp;end. And I&nbsp;was scared. I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;share this child that was all mine with anyone else.” On&nbsp;December&nbsp;29, 1968, 34-year-old Sophia Loren gave birth to&nbsp;her first son, Carlo Ponti&nbsp;Jr.</p><p>And 4&nbsp;years later, the actress got pregnant again. But this time, she decided to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;work. Until she was in&nbsp;her fifth month of&nbsp;pregnancy, she filmed <i>Man of&nbsp;La&nbsp;Mancha</i> with Peter O’Toole. And <strong>her estrogen injections were done by&nbsp;her dressmaker. </strong>The remaining months, the star spent time in&nbsp;Geneva to&nbsp;be&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the clinic.</p><p>On&nbsp;January&nbsp;6, 1973, her son, Edoardo, was born. “After having my&nbsp;first child, I’d thought life couldn’t get any better. But Edo actually doubled my&nbsp;happiness,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>.</p><p><h2>The mother of&nbsp;talented children</h2></p><p>Sophia Loren’s children are artistic people, just like their mother. Her elder son, Carlo Ponti&nbsp;Jr., is&nbsp;a&nbsp;world-famous orchestral <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conductor</a> who’s won many awards. He’s married and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>has</a> 2&nbsp;children.</p><p>Her younger son, Edoardo, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;film director, and some of&nbsp;his movies were presented at&nbsp;different film festivals. And in&nbsp;his 2020&nbsp;movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Life Ahead</i></a>, Lauren played the lead part. Edoardo is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;actress Sasha Alexander, and the couple has 2&nbsp;children, Lucia and Leonardo.</p><p>“What always fed my&nbsp;mother’s life force was her family. <strong>We&nbsp;were never overshadowed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family or&nbsp;as&nbsp;children by&nbsp;her accomplishments.</strong> We&nbsp;always were made to&nbsp;feel like we&nbsp;were her best accomplishments,” Edoardo <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. In&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>memoir</a>, <i>Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow: My&nbsp;Life</i>, Loren wrote, “Being a&nbsp;mom is&nbsp;the greatest role of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</p><p>In&nbsp;our next article, we&nbsp;spotlight Sophia Loren’s unapologetic <a href=#><strong>embrace of&nbsp;body hair</strong></a>, illustrating how it&nbsp;symbolizes her remarkable strength and admirable character. With a&nbsp;storied career spanning decades, an&nbsp;enduring iconic allure, and a&nbsp;commitment to&nbsp;unwavering authenticity, she has indisputably secured her position as&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspirational Hollywood luminary.</p><p>Preview photo credit EAST NEWS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq6iqqWK8p3nSqKehoZFiubC%2BxKdksKCfYsSmutNmq6Gqn6q0qXnMmqWyZZiWv6W%2Fx6KnrGWkpHqjscKopJ5lkWK6sMDHnqlmcGBuhHqEjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
