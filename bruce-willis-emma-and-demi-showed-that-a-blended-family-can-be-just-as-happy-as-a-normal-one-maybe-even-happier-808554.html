We&nbsp;hope it&nbsp;will help other families too.</p><p><h2>Bruce and Demi were once happily married, but their union lasted for only 12&nbsp;years.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a5d/4f2/1273615ee1be459f18b24f46fd.jpg><p>Bruce Willis and Demi Moore met in&nbsp;1987, and after only 4&nbsp;months, they tied the knot. The couple had a&nbsp;fairy-tale-like romance, but unfortunately, that only lasted until they welcomed their first daughter, Rumer. When reality kicked in&nbsp;and their “honeymoon phase” was over, they started being more passionate about having kids than they were about their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriage</a>.</p><p>They started experiencing issues when they had a&nbsp;conflict of&nbsp;interest&nbsp;— Demi wanted to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;acting and Bruce wanted her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;stay-at-home mom. Demi, however, filmed the movie, <i>Ghost</i>, and became a&nbsp;superstar. And even though Bruce was proud of&nbsp;her work, he&nbsp;wasn’t comfortable with the attention his wife was getting and said to&nbsp;her that he&nbsp;didn’t know if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20a/6cb/142ef2550789044bb372c429e7.jpg><p>Bruce didn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;guy that walks out on&nbsp;his family, and Demi’s second and third pregnancies with daughters Scout and Tallulah kept them together. However, that didn’t help them restore their romance, and they divorced after 12&nbsp;years <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>together</a>.</p><p><h2>They didn’t let their differences come between their daughters and continued to&nbsp;support them together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d05/1f7/6f7f8052f9ad33825ee167873b.jpg><p>Bruce and Demi had a&nbsp;largely amicable divorce. Neither of&nbsp;them made the split difficult by&nbsp;obscuring access to&nbsp;their kids, and they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;stay friends for their children’s sake.</p><p>Demi wrote in&nbsp;her memoir that she’s very proud of&nbsp;her divorce and that she feels more connected to&nbsp;Bruce now than she did when they were married. “It&nbsp;wasn’t easy at&nbsp;first, but we&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;move the heart of&nbsp;our relationship, the heart of&nbsp;what created our family, into something new that gave the girls a&nbsp;<a href=# title=loving data-link=tag>loving</a>, supportive environment with both parents,” she revealed.</p><p><h2>Bruce and Demi also support each other in&nbsp;their new romantic relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef9/0bd/45e20b53dfb56e89f2912231c6.jpg><p>After the divorce, Moore married <a href=# title="Ashton Kutcher" data-link=tag>Ashton Kutcher</a> (they divorced in&nbsp;2011, after 6&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage), but that didn’t stop <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>them</a> from continuing their <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> and co-parenting. They were even photographed together at&nbsp;several movie premiers.</p><p>In&nbsp;2009, Bruce married Emma Heming, the love of&nbsp;his life. Demi attended the ceremony together with their 3&nbsp;daughters, and that was just the beginning of&nbsp;their journey as&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving, blended family.</p><p><h2>Their children are also thankful to&nbsp;Demi and Bruce for making an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;stay friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff4/798/1239275dd9801f117b6e9e69da.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Demi and Bruce’s oldest daughter, Rumer, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “I&nbsp;never had to&nbsp;split up&nbsp;vacations or&nbsp;split up&nbsp;birthdays. They always made an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the family events still together and made such an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;still have our family be&nbsp;as&nbsp;one unit, as&nbsp;opposed to&nbsp;2&nbsp;separate things, which&nbsp;I think really made an&nbsp;impact.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;friends who grew up&nbsp;with parents who got divorced at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age and&nbsp;I watched their parents, like, pit them against each other or&nbsp;have to&nbsp;choose between holidays. And I&nbsp;didn’t have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that, and&nbsp;I feel so&nbsp;grateful that my&nbsp;parents made it&nbsp;such a&nbsp;priority that we&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;family, even though it&nbsp;looked <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>different</a>.”</p><p><h2>Emma and Bruce have 2&nbsp;daughters together who made the family whole.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a18/a06/b365505bb18d7aac7f8210cdbe.jpg><p>The 5&nbsp;sisters love being around each other. The little ones&nbsp;— Mabel and Evelyn&nbsp;— adore their big siblings, and when they are around them, they completely forget about their mother and father. That’s why Bruce and Emma decided to&nbsp;move west, so&nbsp;their families could be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;each other and give their kids the opportunity to&nbsp;bond with their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>siblings</a>.</p><h2>Demi and Emma respect each other and are thankful for their blended <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a>.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/077/cf4/7b3a255c2c9ccb0ffe6ce4d75e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2019, on&nbsp;their tenth marriage anniversary, Bruce and Emma decided to&nbsp;renew their vows. Moore was also a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;this intimate event, and Emma <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that she wouldn’t have done it&nbsp;without her.</p><p>“She welcomed me&nbsp;into her family as&nbsp;I welcomed her into ours,” Emma said. “I&nbsp;have so&nbsp;much respect for her. I&nbsp;have so&nbsp;much respect for how Bruce and Demi worked through their divorce to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;put their children first. I&nbsp;learned so&nbsp;much from that and grew so&nbsp;much from watching that. It&nbsp;was important for her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fba/525/71261256cf891fd54ce2d695fb.jpg><p>Demi considers Emma a&nbsp;gorgeous woman and a&nbsp;beautiful mother who’s dedicated to&nbsp;her family. “I&nbsp;see her as&nbsp;family who I&nbsp;am honored to&nbsp;call a&nbsp;friend. Our children are sisters and yet there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;name for what our family connection is&nbsp;to&nbsp;one another,” Moore <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> on&nbsp;Instagram for International Women’s Day. “We&nbsp;are mothers united, sisters bonded on&nbsp;this crazy adventure of&nbsp;life.”</p><p><h2>There’s no&nbsp;jealousy between them, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;means Bruce spending nearly a&nbsp;month at&nbsp;his ex-wife’s house.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffc/5a5/892ca25297b195290edaad5329.jpg><p>Bruce, Demi, their 3&nbsp;grown-up daughters, and their daughters’ boyfriends spent nearly a&nbsp;month together in&nbsp;Idaho at&nbsp;Demi’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>place</a>. The family was posting pictures on&nbsp;their Instagram profile, wearing matching pajamas and having fun. This “reunion” didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bother</a> Bruce’s wife, Emma, and later, when the actor returned to&nbsp;California to&nbsp;his wife and 2&nbsp;daughters, they celebrated a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cozy</a> Christmas together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c43/733/50d78a5c0bb513eca283a3bf13.jpg><p><h2>They all get along so&nbsp;well that they’ve become like a&nbsp;tribe.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f20/0b4/c918015d92acff183f1d3a72f9.jpg><p>Even though Bruce and Demi are still friends after so&nbsp;many years, the public still can’t understand how they do&nbsp;it. “Everyone can understand resentment and envy in&nbsp;the breakup of&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage, but they don’t understand how&nbsp;I can get along with my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;like that,” Bruce <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. “Demi and&nbsp;I made a&nbsp;choice to&nbsp;put the kids first, and we’re really lucky that it&nbsp;turns out we&nbsp;all have fun together.
