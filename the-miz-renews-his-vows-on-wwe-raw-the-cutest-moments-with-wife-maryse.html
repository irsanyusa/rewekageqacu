The couple, both of whom are in the WWE, first got married in 2014. They have a TV show on the USA Network called Miz & Mrs.</strong></p><p>To celebrate the couple’s vow renewal, we thought it would be fun to look back at some of their sweetest moments together. The couple has two daughters together named Madison and Monroe, and they love to share their life with fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-the-miz-and-maryse-renew-their-wedding-vows>1. The Miz and Maryse Renew Their Wedding Vows</h2><p>The couple renewed their vows on Monday’s episode of WWE Raw, in front of a crowd of wrestling fans. The event wasn’t without its crazy moments, as fellow wrestler Edge interrupted the vows and tried to embarrass the couple by covering them with a Brood bath.</p><p>If you’re looking for something a little sweeter (and less greasy), check out the montage Miz posted on <a href=#>Instagram</a> reminiscing on his and Maryse’s original wedding in 2014. “Hey&nbsp;@marysemizanin&nbsp;I think I want to marry you….again,” he wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-miz-surprises-maryse-with-a-playroom-for-monroe>2.

He gave Maryse a new golf club and took her to the room, which was decked out with toys and colorful decorations.</p><p>“I wish I had a playroom like that when I was a child,” Maryse said of the surprise. We’ll just ignore the part where the couple’s dog Pumpkin peed on the floor and focus on the sweet surprise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-miz-tries-to-teach-maryse-how-to-dance>3.

In one clip, he tries to show her the proper form, but Maryse can’t stop goofing around and showing off some not-so-appropriate moves.</p><p>Maryse may not have been the best ballroom partner, but she did cheer her husband on through seven weeks of competition before he was eliminated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVoYolyAhPG/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-maryse-dresses-up-for-grease-week-on-dwts>4. Maryse Dresses Up for ‘Grease’ Week on ‘DWTS’</h3><p>Trying out some dance moves wasn’t the only way Maryse supported her husband during his time on Dancing with the Stars. She helped him get into character for Grease week by dressing up as the Sandy to his Danny, in tight black pants and an off-the-shoulder top.</p><p>The couple posed for photos in their costumes, cuddling up in a vintage car. Miz and his partner Witney Carson earned a score of 32 for their Jive to the song “Greased Lightnin’.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVLSxPSPE7p/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-maryse-tells-miz-she-s-pregnant>5. Maryse Tells Miz She’s Pregnant</h3><p>On a 2018 episode of their show, Maryse revealed to Miz that she was pregnant with their first daughter Monroe. Miz was eating a sandwich at the kitchen counter when Maryse put down her positive pregnancy test and told him, “Congratulations, Dad.”</p><p>Miz asked if she was 100 percent positive she was pregnant, and Maryse proceeded to show him all the other pregnancy tests she had taken that came up positive. Miz was stunned by the news. Now he’s <a href=#>the father to two little girls</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nick-Cannon-Abby-De-La-Rosa-Mariah-Carey-The-Masked-Singer-scaled-1.jpeg alt="Hear the Soundtrack to Nick Cannon’s Movie ‘Miracles Across 125th Street’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWZr3qzsc2erqxlmJ7AbsLOsKpmp55ixLixjKuYsGWknbJur9StnKysXaK8rrHNrapmr5mptW7DyJ%2BcZqWRp8a0sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
