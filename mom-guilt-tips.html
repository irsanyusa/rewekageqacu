Ear infection, they tell us. Her first one—and timed perfectly, too. One week after she started daycare and 10 days after we moved our family 500-plus miles from Washington, D.C. to Charleston, South Carolina. My husband had been traveling internationally the prior week, and I was about to head to the airport for a week of West Coast travel. We certainly weren’t making this big life transition easy on our toddler.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Enter the guilt. It was palpable as I said goodbye from the curb, it solidified as my plane took off and it became increasingly painful as the week wore on. As my daughter’s infection traveled to her other ear and my husband tried to play executive and doting dad in a new city where we had no help, my guilt grew exponentially.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Guilt isn’t just a parental thing, but women tend to feel guilt more; researchers have confirmed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gender differences in guilt</a>. That means it’s important to think carefully about how to manage it. Here are the steps that other moms tell me have helped them—and that I’ve come to use myself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>‘Why Healthy, Successful Women Can Still “Need” Men’</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1. Be open and honest<br></strong>Since guilt can happen in any relationship, being up-front is key. Be clear about where you’re going (on a work trip or to the coffee shop) and why. And if you’re still feeling guilty, Rachel Bell, a communications consultant, military spouse and mom of two, recommends saying it out loud to a loved one—or even just to yourself. When her daughter recently took a tumble at school (on a day when she was late to pick her up), she felt bad for not being there.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Saying it out loud helped me realize it sounds so silly,” she says. “Of course she’s going to fall a lot, whether I’m there or not.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>What You Can Do About Donald Trump’s Bullying</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2. Use technology<br></strong>Time away from your family is unavoidable. Video chatting, sending video messages or even just writing emails can make it easier. Regular phone or webcam dates give you something to look forward to and remind others that you’re always there and accessible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3. Fill your own cup<br></strong>Stephanie Brown, a family-based clinician, is fond of saying, “Remember that you need to put your oxygen mask on before you can help your child with his or hers.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although it may be trite, the idea that you can’t save someone else until you’ve saved yourself is pretty powerful. If you’re so out of the habit of saving yourself that you don’t know where to start, Brown suggests identifying what reinvigorates you and making a point of doing it on a regular basis. Perhaps meditating or walking in the woods helps you recoup energy. Knowing that and working those into your schedule will enable you to show up more as a parent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Once we create the space [for that activity] and add it in as a small goal, it starts to become a practice of self-love,” says Brown.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And filling your cup doesn’t have to be hard. It’s all about reprioritization. You can be better in your relationships if you fill your own cup first. And when you’re feeling better, you minimize those emotions of guilt.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#>WNBA MVP Says People Have Told Her to ‘Go Back to the Kitchen’</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As my plane took off from Seattle back to Charleston, I made a decision. I could worry for the next five hours, or I could accept the fact that I couldn’t parent from a plane—and tell myself that was O.K. I can do this.
