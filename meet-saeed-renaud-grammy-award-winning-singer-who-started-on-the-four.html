This singer showed off his smooth yet soulful vocal range. This singer got a seat on the first episode of the series, but faced elimination after only four performances.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-saeed-renaud-takes-the-world-by-storm-on-the-four-battle-to-stardom>Saeed Renaud Takes The World by Storm on The Four: Battle to Stardom</h2><p>Renaud took to The Four: Battle For Stardom stage singing “Run to You” by Whitney Houston. No one expected this singer to premiere a voice filled with grace and beauty. It was clear that he had been singing for years. Renaud began singing at the age of six. This singer is one of 21 children and he grew up singing in a family choir. By the age of nine, he began writing his own music.</p><p>Meghan Trainor was in tears during his performance. Renaud was able to challenge one of the four singers already sat. During the challenge, he performed the energetic song “Love Me Again” by John Newman. The audience chose to include this singer in the four. He took his rightful spot.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/SwaCalMqHbg</p></figure><p>After two other strong performances of “Superstition” by Stevie Wonder and “All My Life” by K-Ci and JoJo, he was eliminated in week three of the competition. Even though he didn’t win the overall season, he’s gone on to have a successful career in 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is This Singer Up to In 2022?</h2><p>Renaud is now apart of the Grammy and BMI Award winning songwriter duo Tha Authors featuring him and Fields Blanchard. Tha Authors has written one of BMI’s Top Most Performed Gospel Songs “Bless This house,” and was apart of Lalah Hathaway’s album Lalah Hathaway Live. Hathaway’s album won a Grammy Award in 2016 for best R&B album.</p><p>When it comes to his own singing, Renaud was picked by the late Aretha Franklin to open for her and was a background vocalist for R&B singer Chrisette Michele. On top of performing on stage, Renaud has credits for contributing his voice to the albums of many other artists.</p><p>Now, he’s a vocal producer, arranger, and vocal coach. In the past few years, he’s dropped a few singles “Last Forever” and “Holy Water.” In 2019, the singer released an album called Two Sides. Renaud’s social media has tons of music content, so I’d say even more releases are on the way for this singer/songwriter.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NUP_196604_00296.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson Says Well-Known Artists Need to ‘Work Harder’ on ‘American Song Contest’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Saeed Renaud</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Four: Battle for Stardom</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWjlrKmsIyrnKeZpZl6qL7ApqSyZZGsrrOwjLCgp6aZo7Ruv8innp6qXay1sHnSrZirrJWZerC6jK2fnmWWpMKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
