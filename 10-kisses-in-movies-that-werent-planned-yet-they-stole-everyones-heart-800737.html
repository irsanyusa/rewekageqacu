What is&nbsp;the best way to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;scene as&nbsp;genuine as&nbsp;possible? Improvise, of&nbsp;course! It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;intimidating to&nbsp;take your co-star by&nbsp;surprise and lay an&nbsp;unexpected kiss on&nbsp;them, but in&nbsp;almost all cases, the reward justifies the risk.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>respect the actors who do&nbsp;whatever it&nbsp;takes to&nbsp;entertain&nbsp;us, and this time, we’re turning to&nbsp;scenes in&nbsp;movies and&nbsp;TV shows that were elevated by&nbsp;unplanned smooches.</p><p><h2>1. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard in&nbsp;Jurassic World</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/065/9fe/8b736354b4b4ef0750f79844f7.jpg><p>There’s a&nbsp;scene where Howard’s character finds inner courage and saves Pratt’s character. Then, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gesture of&nbsp;admiration and gratitude, he&nbsp;gives her a&nbsp;beautiful and cinematic kiss. In&nbsp;<a href=#>reality</a>, it&nbsp;was all <a href=# title="Chris Pratt" data-link=tag>Chris Pratt</a> thinking on&nbsp;his feet: <strong>“[The kiss] was spontaneous. It&nbsp;wasn’t written in&nbsp;there</strong>...We had shot the scene in&nbsp;the way that it&nbsp;was written—there was no&nbsp;kiss. And then, on&nbsp;the last day, that happened—what you see in&nbsp;the movie... Everyone was cheering. It&nbsp;was great!”</p><p><h2>2. Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams in&nbsp;American Hustle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba7/faa/ac14b75573b58522a56b76280b.jpg><p>Amy Adams <a href=#>revealed</a> that she and <a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lawrence</a> decided to&nbsp;aggressively kiss in<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the middle of&nbsp;their characters’ fight, even though there was nothing remotely similar in&nbsp;the script: <strong>“We&nbsp;were talking about the scene and&nbsp;I was like ’How about if&nbsp;she kisses her?’</strong> And [the director] understood... Jennifer was totally game. It&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;being like the perfect exclamation point on&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic conversation.”</p><p><h2>3. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/920/725/4ce0b75ed28785c209e830e716.jpg><p>The most touching moment of&nbsp;the entire movie was seeing Luke and Leia reunite after years of&nbsp;being apart. Mark Hamill disappeared in&nbsp;that scene and gave the late Carrie Fisher an&nbsp;<a href=#>unplanned</a> but tender kiss on&nbsp;the forehead, which became an&nbsp;ultimate farewell between the characters and actors: “I&nbsp;didn’t decide it&nbsp;and say, ’Can I&nbsp;do this?’ I&nbsp;mean, in&nbsp;the take&nbsp;— I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;we&nbsp;rehearsed it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, but it&nbsp;just happened. I&nbsp;was standing up&nbsp;and they weren’t ready for&nbsp;it. And we&nbsp;did it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;second take, and like I&nbsp;said, <strong>it&nbsp;was just spontaneous</strong>.”</p><p><h2>4. Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks in&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay&nbsp;— Part&nbsp;2</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a3f/71c/83c36b5a7e835ef5aa6c50e74c.jpg><p>We&nbsp;definitely didn’t see this kiss coming in&nbsp;the final part of&nbsp;The Hunger Games series, but we’d be&nbsp;lying if&nbsp;we&nbsp;said we&nbsp;didn’t want&nbsp;it. As&nbsp;Banks <a href=#>revealed</a>: “<strong>Woody and&nbsp;I went into that moment, that wasn’t written, we&nbsp;improv’d that. </strong>We&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, and the director was like, ‘I love&nbsp;it. Let’s try it&nbsp;again.’” Harrelson also <a href=#>admitted</a> that he&nbsp;probably enjoyed that moment even more than we&nbsp;did: “I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;Elizabeth Banks, I’m not going to&nbsp;lie.”</p><p><h2>5. Helena Bonham Carter and Julian Sands in&nbsp;A&nbsp;Room with a&nbsp;View</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f77/9ea/d30e3f5204b4f4c8779ac085dd.jpg><p>This movie is&nbsp;regarded as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the <a href=#>most romantic</a> films of&nbsp;all time, and its iconic kiss in&nbsp;the field could stir anyone’s heart. <a href=# title="Helena Bonham Carter" data-link=tag>Helena Bonham Carter</a> actually <a href=#>revealed</a> that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;wild ride for her: “<strong>You know the kiss that ended up&nbsp;being something everyone loved? That was totally improvised, right at&nbsp;the last minute.</strong>” The actress was only 18&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time and says she was trying her hardest not to&nbsp;laugh when Sands kissed her because she was inexperienced. We’re glad Helena stayed in&nbsp;the moment!</p><p><h2>6. Indira Varma and Gemma Whelan in&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d0/4de/8b821f5a03b0ea5a2a27306a8e.jpg><p>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;show like Game of&nbsp;Thrones, it’s surprising to&nbsp;find out that there was an&nbsp;unscripted intimate moment between the characters. However, when Varma and Whelan’s characters finally came together in&nbsp;season&nbsp;7, it&nbsp;felt natural to&nbsp;the actresses to&nbsp;finish the scene with a&nbsp;flirtatious kiss. As&nbsp;Varma <a href=#>revealed</a>: “<strong>It&nbsp;wasn’t directed that we&nbsp;would kiss.</strong> It&nbsp;just seemed like something we&nbsp;should&nbsp;do.”</p><p><h2>7. Max Greenfield and Jake Johnson in&nbsp;New Girl</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ff/625/be926457d8b3c63e484c71bb7f.jpg><p>Greenfield had his own vision for his and Johnson’s characters’ friendship on&nbsp;the show and tried kissing him several times, after which, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;running gag on&nbsp;New Girl. As&nbsp;Jake <a href=#>said</a>: “<strong>Max improvised kissed me&nbsp;a&nbsp;bunch on&nbsp;the show.</strong>” Greenfield added that he&nbsp;had some convincing to&nbsp;do: “Jake was against it&nbsp;at&nbsp;first, and I&nbsp;said: ’Just go&nbsp;with&nbsp;it, let it&nbsp;happen, let it&nbsp;be&nbsp;free, let it&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the moment.’”</p><p><h2>8. Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth in&nbsp;The Last Song</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ace/64f/5e56615eb9bcfcbcdb8b19b7e8.jpg><p><a href=# title=Miley data-link=tag>Miley</a> and Liam’s past romance blossomed on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;The Last Song and it&nbsp;all started with an&nbsp;unplanned kiss. Hemsworth <a href=#>revealed</a> that they were filming on&nbsp;the beach on&nbsp;the very first day of&nbsp;work and that they <a href=# title=got data-link=tag>got</a> into the lovey-dovey stuff right off the bat: “<strong>The funny thing about that scene was that originally there was no&nbsp;kiss in&nbsp;that scene.</strong> And the director was yelling out things throughout the scene, halfway through she yelled out: ’Kiss!’ So&nbsp;we&nbsp;kinda got thrown into&nbsp;it, which was good cause, you know, I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;get nervous about&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>9. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in&nbsp;Lost in&nbsp;Translation</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/103/8d6/4362625e95b0a47710793c7831.jpg><p>Master of&nbsp;comedy, Bill Murray, apparently loved keeping his co-star on&nbsp;her toes during the filming of&nbsp;Lost in&nbsp;Translation. Director Sofia Coppola <a href=#>explained</a> that the iconic farewell between their characters never meant to&nbsp;include a&nbsp;kiss. It&nbsp;was Murray who went with his gut and created something very special: “It&nbsp;was always meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;this tender goodbye where they both knew that they had touched each other in&nbsp;some way.<strong> And I&nbsp;remember sometimes he&nbsp;would always spring things on&nbsp;her, and it&nbsp;was fun to&nbsp;get her reaction.</strong>”</p><p><h2>10. Steve Carell and Oscar Nunez in&nbsp;The Office</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ab5/766/d0a6d25d8dbbff8b9c5ec750b3.png><p>Was this censored in more conservatives countries?</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode where Steve Carell’s character found out that one of&nbsp;his subordinates was gay, the actor decided it&nbsp;was his time to&nbsp;shine. At&nbsp;one point, Michael Scott accepts Oscar and shows it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very intrusive, but hilarious manner. Nunez <a href=#>said</a> he&nbsp;did not see the kiss coming: “<strong>He&nbsp;wasn’t supposed to&nbsp;kiss&nbsp;me, we&nbsp;were just supposed to&nbsp;hug,</strong> and he&nbsp;kept hugging&nbsp;me. And that particular take he&nbsp;came in&nbsp;really close, and I’m like, ‘Where is&nbsp;he&nbsp;going with this?’ Oh, dear, yes here we&nbsp;go.” Huge props to&nbsp;him for not laughing during that scene.</p><p>Did you know about these?
