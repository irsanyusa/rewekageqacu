Don’t be confused by the different names when you practice <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English grammar exercises</a>. They are the same tense!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">simple past</a> (for regular verbs, this is verb + -ed) describes an action in the past that is completed.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I walk<strong>ed</strong> to the park.</li></ul><p>The simple past is important when using the past progressive tense. More information on this is below.&nbsp;</p><p>We use the past progressive tense to describe actions that were in progress at a specific time in the past. We describe an action that started in the past and was then interrupted by another action.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>She<strong> was sleeping </strong>when the alarm sound<strong>ed</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>They <strong>were driving</strong> when the rain start<strong>ed</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>You <strong>were eating</strong> when the doorbell rang.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These sentences use the<strong> past continuous </strong>followed by the past simple interruption. The past continuous verb here conveys the past progressive tense (remember, these terms mean the same thing).&nbsp;</p><p>We also use the past progressive to describe two actions that were in progress at the same time in the past.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>He <strong>was cooking</strong> while I <strong>was reading</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The dogs <strong>were barking</strong> while I <strong>was talking</strong> on the phone.&nbsp;</li><li>I <strong>was sleeping</strong> when you <strong>were working</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In these examples, both actions are happening at the same time in the past. Both use the past progressive tense. We use the words while or when to connect the two actions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-form-the-past-progressive-tense>How to form the past progressive tense</h2><p>The past progressive tense uses this formula:&nbsp;</p><p>Subject + was / were + present participle (verb + ing)</p><ul><li>I <strong>was sleeping</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>They <strong>were sleeping</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Past progressive sentences must include was or were, both past tense forms of the verb to be. Let’s review the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">verb to be</a> to see that there are only those two options:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subject</strong></td><td><strong>To Be</strong></td></tr><tr><td>I&nbsp;</td><td>was</td></tr><tr><td>You (singular)</td><td>were</td></tr><tr><td>He / She / It&nbsp;</td><td>was</td></tr><tr><td>You (plural)</td><td>were</td></tr><tr><td>We</td><td>were</td></tr><tr><td>They</td><td>were</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The past progressive tense must also include the present participle. If you didn’t remember that the present participle is made by adding -ing to a verb, feel free to take an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English grammar review</a> break.</p><p>Above, we learned how to form positive sentences. We should also learn to form negative sentences in the past progressive. In order to make the phrase negative, we need to add the word not to our sentence. Here is the formula.&nbsp;</p><p>Subject + was / were + not + present participle (-ing verb)</p><ul><li>I <strong>was not sleeping</strong>.</li><li>They <strong>were not sleeping</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We can also use a contraction in negative sentences.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I <strong>wasn’t sleeping</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>They <strong>weren’t sleeping</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Example-sentences>Example sentences</h2><p>Let’s take a look at some more past progressive tense examples. Use these sentences to practice more on your own. Try to substitute different verbs to describe actions you observed yesterday, last week or last year.</p><ul><li>They <strong>were cleaning</strong> the house when the man arriv<strong>ed</strong> at the door.&nbsp;</li><li>I <strong>was running </strong>while the baby <strong>was sleeping.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>We <strong>were working </strong>when the fire started in the building.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The past progressive tense is especially useful for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">asking questions</a> about the past. We can ask two main types of questions. We have simple Yes/No questions and open-ended questions, which use a question word. Note: For questions, you will notice the subject and the verb are separated.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Yes/No questions formula</h3><p>Was / Were + Subject + present participle (-ing)</p><ul><li><strong>Was </strong>the baby <strong>sleeping </strong>while you <strong>were running</strong>?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Were </strong>you <strong>cooking </strong>when he call<strong>ed</strong>?&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Open-ended questions using a question word formula&nbsp;</h3><p>Question words are who, what, when, where, why and how.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>What <strong>was </strong>John <strong>doing </strong>when the man call<strong>ed</strong>?&nbsp;</li><li>Where <strong>were </strong>you when the baby <strong>was crying</strong>?</li><li>Why <strong>were </strong>you <strong>working</strong> when they<strong> were visiting</strong> you?&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What were you doing while they were studying English?</h2><p>The past progressive tense is a widely used English verb tense. Learning it will help you communicate in more complex ways. And it can help you sound more natural and fluent. Whether you learn British English or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American English</a>, understanding different ways to talk about the past will take practice. In the end, your time and effort will be worth it.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
