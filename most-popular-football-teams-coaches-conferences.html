Deion Sanders recently arrived at the University of Colorado to much fanfare, media buzz and on-field expectations. From sold-out season tickets to celebrities like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson on the Buffaloes’ sidelines, the “Coach Prime” effect is already having an outsized impact on a recently dormant football program.
And while Sanders’ squad won’t contend for a College Football Playoff championship this campaign, the former NFL and MLB star with no prior Football Bowl Subdivision coaching experience can already claim that he’s one of college football’s most popular coaches."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh and Alabama’s Nick Saban rounded out the top three, scoring favorability ratings of 49% and 48%, respectively.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Business is booming for Sanders, who signed a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>reported</a> five-year, $29.5 million deal to lead the Buffaloes. His natural charisma and boisterous personality have made him an instant media darling, whether it’s on <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>ESPN</a> or his son’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>YouTube channel</a>, the latter of which chronicles behind the scenes at Colorado and has hundreds of thousands of more followers than the football program’s own channel.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Already seen in national TV commercials for Aflac and Kentucky Fried Chicken, Sanders is also making his presence known via Amazon’s streaming service. Last winter, Prime Video released a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>four-part docuseries</a> on Sanders’ final season at Jackson State, a historically Black college that competes in the Football Championship Subdivision, before his transition to the Power Five. Season 2 of “Coach Prime” will debut on Prime Video next month.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Interest in the 56-year-old Sanders, who <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>generated over $90 million in earned media value</a> for the university through the first few weeks of this season, should only grow, whether he stays in Boulder long term or moves on to a bigger campus.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Buckeyes on top of college football</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the Buffaloes have garnered tons of attention under Sanders, the team still has a way to go before it becomes a favorite among the college football fandom, where Ohio State reigns at the top.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Buckeyes are among the top five all-time winningest college football programs, so it’s not a surprise they are college sports fans’ favorite team.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Morning Consult asked college sports fans to write in their favorite college football program. The Buckeyes came in at No. 1, with 6% of college sports fans saying they support Ohio State, followed by Georgia and Notre Dame (4% each) to complete the top three.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Winning is familiar to the Buckeyes, who won the inaugural College Football Playoff title in the 2014 season. Ohio State, which <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>debuted atop</a> the College Football Playoff rankings last week, has finished every season of the new postseason era in the top 10. Meanwhile, Georgia and Alabama have accounted for five of the most recent nine national titles, including back-to-back victories for the Bulldogs.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though the Buckeyes haven’t won a football national championship in nearly a decade, the program has competed atop the Big Ten for years. Ohio State, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>one of the country’s largest universities</a>, won four consecutive conference championships from 2017 to 2020.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Buckeyes also have the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>third-most regular-season wins</a> in the College Football Playoff era and count LeBron James as one of their biggest celebrity fans. Over the years, the four-time NBA champ has gifted school-branded <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Beats by Dre headphones</a> and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>custom cleats</a> to the football team. And Ohio State’s new <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>apparel collaboration</a> with Lululemon will provide a brand boost for the activewear company.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When it comes to conference allegiances, 56% of college sports fans said they typically root for schools in the Big Ten or Southeastern Conference each, versus 45% who said the same for each of the remaining Power Five conferences.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">For the conferences’ media rights holders — ESPN and ABC <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>secured</a> an exclusive 10-year deal with the SEC in 2020, while a year ago CBS, Fox and NBC all <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>announced</a> a 7-year partnership with the Big Ten — the billions of dollars committed to each entity have been a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>worthwhile investment</a>.
