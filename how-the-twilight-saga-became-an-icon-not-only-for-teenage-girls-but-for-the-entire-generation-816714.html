Just imagine, the iconic question “How long have you been&nbsp;17?” has already turned 15&nbsp;years old in&nbsp;2023. But even though many people watched the vampire saga with disdain in&nbsp;the beginning, now it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;never ending source of&nbsp;memes and nostalgia. How have <i>The Twilight Saga</i> managed to&nbsp;keep the love of&nbsp;the audience for so&nbsp;many years? Let’s find out in&nbsp;this article.</p><p><h2>The story seemed too shallow to&nbsp;the audience.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e52/38f/35a6e955a5b0064cd890bf46e1.jpg><p>After release, <i>Twilight</i> was immediately dubbed a&nbsp;“teenage story.” And it’s no&nbsp;wonder. The movie theaters were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filled</a> with schoolgirls for the most part while older people believed that this franchise didn’t really deserve this crazy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>love of</a>&nbsp;fans. But it&nbsp;wasn’t only the movie that was criticized, the book was criticized as&nbsp;well. Stephen King, for example, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that “Stephenie Meyer can’t write worth a&nbsp;darn.” And even ordinary readers whose comments we&nbsp;found online were not fond of&nbsp;the book either.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;read them all so&nbsp;that&nbsp;I could have an&nbsp;opinion on&nbsp;them, and god they were terrible. I’m usually a&nbsp;fast reader, but it&nbsp;took me&nbsp;months to&nbsp;get through them, especially the last book, because every second or&nbsp;third page I’d have to&nbsp;put the book down and go&nbsp;“What the heck ?” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;FortLagomorph&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>When <i>Twilight</i> was at&nbsp;its peak, I&nbsp;would occasionally use excerpts of&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;class, and invite my&nbsp;seventh graders to&nbsp;find the comma errors.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Digger-of-Tunnels&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;thought <i>Twilight</i> was badly written... then&nbsp;I read <i>Fifty Shades of&nbsp;Grey.&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Unknown author&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>The movie characters were mocked online.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/251/470/917f9c5e7f835356bf01529064.jpg><p>You probably remember multiple jokes about Bella Swan’s emotional range that appeared online. Viewers laughed at&nbsp;her “always open mouth” and the lack of&nbsp;any emotion on&nbsp;her face. The main character <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seemed</a> empty to&nbsp;them, and some viewers genuinely wondered why all guys around her fell for her.</p><ul><li>Can someone explain to&nbsp;me&nbsp;what exactly all these men are seeing in&nbsp;Bella Swan? I&nbsp;listened to&nbsp;all audiobooks like 4&nbsp;times already and I’m still not finding it&nbsp;like mamma has no&nbsp;personality, no&nbsp;character, no&nbsp;rizz, and some serious mental health problems.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Yalaeinhorn2704&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Edward, played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Robert Pattinson" data-link=tag>Robert Pattinson</a>, was generally more loved by&nbsp;the audience, but still the actor has been labelled as&nbsp;not cool enough for the role a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>to</a>&nbsp;some fans, Robert didn’t look like the book vampire at&nbsp;all. It’s funny, but about 3&nbsp;days after the actor landed the role, fans even sent a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>petition</a> against this choice and attached Robert’s bad photo with the words, “THIS is&nbsp;Edward.” It&nbsp;got up&nbsp;to&nbsp;75,000&nbsp;signings, but surely this petition wasn’t successful.</p><ul><li>Both Robert and Bella were stale in&nbsp;the movies. Maybe because of&nbsp;how boring the actors are (Robert became a&nbsp;way better actor later&nbsp;on), but they both played the characters like cardboard.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Maleficent-Leg-9307&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>The series was criticized for its anti-feminist message.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca1/a49/d94df1541ca4d44c1fa1d40dac.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;some viewers, the girls in&nbsp;this franchise exist only to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with their men. And it’s not just Bella: other female characters also exist as&nbsp;an&nbsp;appendix to&nbsp;their beloved. For example, Rosalie once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that the only thing worth living for is&nbsp;to&nbsp;“have been allowed to&nbsp;marry someone who loved me&nbsp;and have pretty babies.” And while Bella is&nbsp;struggling to&nbsp;choose between human and vampire life, Rosalie argues that it’s not necessary to&nbsp;search for some meaning in&nbsp;life, it’s enough to&nbsp;fulfill that societal female prescription.</p><p>Did you notice how Bella spends her free time? She mostly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stays</a> home and cooks dinners for her father. Likewise, Emily cooks meals for the entire wolf pack nonstop. At&nbsp;the same time, the male characters of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>series</a> are self-sufficient, cool and ambitious.</p><p><h2>But then everything changed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ae/340/500737515f8bcae29734012dfe.jpg><p><i>Twilight</i> was considered a&nbsp;girls movie from the very beginning and wasn’t taken seriously. But nowadays it’s no&nbsp;longer a&nbsp;shame to&nbsp;watch a&nbsp;girls’ movie, it’s not even a&nbsp;guilty pleasure. When the movie was released, people seriously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debated</a> whether it&nbsp;was shameful for a&nbsp;real man to&nbsp;watch <i>Twilight. </i>But now even popular bloggers happily <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>watch </a>the vampire saga and record video reactions.</p><p>Previously it&nbsp;was believed that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movies</a> targeted at&nbsp;female audiences were too silly to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;men. But are stereotypical “male” action movies where characters <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>can</a> spend hours punching each other in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car park, much smarter? The truth is&nbsp;that times are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changing</a>, and there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer a&nbsp;clear division between “male” and “female” movies. In&nbsp;2023, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;absurd to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ashamed of&nbsp;your movie tastes.</p><ul><li><i>Twilight</i> partly shaped my&nbsp;taste in&nbsp;music, and there’s also great visual. There’s no&nbsp;shame in&nbsp;enjoying something that is&nbsp;not liked by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>everyone</a>.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Fair_Ly&nbsp;/ Twitter</a></li></ul><p><h2>The movie has suddenly become feminist.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a0/43f/e284295ef297596978e2d8d680.jpg><p>Suddenly Bella turned from an&nbsp;ordinary girl who preferred to&nbsp;hide in&nbsp;the shadow into a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;girl power. No, nothing has changed in&nbsp;the series, but the audience unexpectedly found something in&nbsp;the main character that they haven’t noticed before. For example, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the saga, Bella takes her fate in&nbsp;her own hands and consciously gives up&nbsp;her human life for the sake of&nbsp;a&nbsp;vampire life. Also, throughout the series, she plays a&nbsp;significant role in&nbsp;bridging human community and vampire community.</p><p>Besides, <i>Twilight </i>has become the first movie to&nbsp;prove that girls’ movies can earn a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money at&nbsp;the box office, that they can become <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blockbusters</a> even with the almost complete absence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;male audience. And if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren’t for <i>Twilight</i>, we&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>might</a> not have seen <i>The Hunger Games</i>, where the story also revolves around a&nbsp;female character.</p><p><h2>Some of&nbsp;the actors made a&nbsp;great career in&nbsp;movies thanks to&nbsp;the vampire saga.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0e/cd0/fae3595235b28fc0002147cb20.jpg><p><i>The Twilight Saga</i> became a&nbsp;breakthrough for the starring actors, but some of&nbsp;them have long got rid of&nbsp;their vampire image, having played in&nbsp;many dramatic movies. For example, Robert Pattinson proved to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;great dramatic talent by&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;the movies like <i>The Lighthouse</i> and <i>The Batman</i>. And the audience doesn’t mention his lack of&nbsp;emotions or&nbsp;beauty in&nbsp;the comments anymore.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;awe of&nbsp;Robert Pattinson. I&nbsp;come from being a&nbsp;teenage <i>Twilight</i> fan to&nbsp;a&nbsp;grown-up who did not expect to&nbsp;still be&nbsp;rooting for him. Dude’s fantastic! <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Oapy&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;was impressed very much with Patterson’s acting range in&nbsp;<i>The Lighthouse.&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;NemesisExecution&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc0/892/3306e55ac1a10025f43fa7e832.jpg><p>Jackson Rathbone, who played Jasper, is&nbsp;also quite successful: his after-<i>Twilight</i> career has been going&nbsp;up. In&nbsp;2023, for example, he&nbsp;has starred in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>three</a> major projects, and even shared a&nbsp;film set with Mickey Rourke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>once</a>.</p><p><h2>While some of&nbsp;the actors may not be&nbsp;popular in&nbsp;movies, but finally feel comfortable with themselves.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f70/7c5/1985e8505186b63ed3e172d7ce.jpg><p>Taylor Lautner, who played Jacob, also moved away from the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;werewolf, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stopped</a> going to&nbsp;the gym and lost his 6-pack for which his character was adored. But we&nbsp;are very happy for the actor, because <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>now</a> he&nbsp;is&nbsp;comfortable with his own body and does not exhaust himself with workouts. However, he&nbsp;has almost disappeared from the screens, and his new movies <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>receive</a> mostly negative reviews. But who knows, maybe we’ll hear about him again.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, his wife’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>name is</a>&nbsp;Taylor too. And she took her spouse’s last name. So, she’s Taylor Lautner now too.</p><p><h2>Plus, people love to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nostalgic.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4a4/bd2/d62090540d9345fbf820345130.jpg><p>We&nbsp;all tend to&nbsp;look <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>back</a> with a&nbsp;good deal of&nbsp;sadness and recall our childhood and youth. We&nbsp;enjoy nostalgia for cultural phenomena of&nbsp;the noughties, like fashion, movies, or&nbsp;TV shows. Thus <i>The Twilight Saga</i> has become another symbol of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bygone beloved era over time, along with subcultures and many other things. And now many people tend to&nbsp;rewatch the saga to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back in&nbsp;time and feel young again.</p><p>And do&nbsp;you remember the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>soundtrack</a>? All the hits of&nbsp;the time by&nbsp;Paramore, Muse or&nbsp;Linkin Park were there. And if&nbsp;in&nbsp;the year of&nbsp;<i>Twilight’s</i> release, we&nbsp;used to&nbsp;cringe and say, “The music is&nbsp;great, but the movie is&nbsp;so&nbsp;bad,” 15&nbsp;years later both the picture and the soundtrack are perceived as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole, and as&nbsp;something that is&nbsp;good to&nbsp;remember.</p><p>And here’s 10&nbsp;actors who could have <a href=#>played</a> in&nbsp;<i>The Twilight Saga</i> if&nbsp;the filmmakers decided to&nbsp;follow Stephenie Meyer’s recommendations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ytn55lpKy2rbXGoatmq5Gcrm6uxJyYpp1dlrtutcKopWamn6l6sLrLsmSfp6JiwaaxzZqenmWXnr%2Btv4ybrK1llqS%2FbsDHnmSepqSev6Z5xp6lnqqRqbawuoxxaG9vYWl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
