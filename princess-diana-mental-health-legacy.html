She walked through fields of <a href=#>landmines</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>embraced</a> an AIDS patient, introduced us to the <a href=#>vicious tenacity</a> of the <a href=# rel=noopener>tabloid press</a> and embodied the most <a href=# rel=noopener>glorious aspects of 1980s fashion</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But what is often forgotten is that Diana was also a paradox: under the magnificently poised image she presented to the world, she struggled with <a href=# rel=noopener>bulimia</a>, self-injury and lingering feelings of worthlessness.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the early 1990s, toward the <a href=# rel=noopener>end of her marriage</a>, Diana gave a series of interviews to promising to share <a href=# rel=noopener>“her true story.”</a> In 1992, Andrew Morton <a href=# rel=noopener>published </a><i>Diana: Her True Story </i>(based on secret recordings Diana had an intermediary <a href=# rel=noopener>make for the author</a>),<i> </i>which revealed that the princess was living with the eating disorder.<i> </i>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>1995 interview</a> with BBC, she described bulimia as a “symptom of what was going on in my marriage.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diana’s candid self-disclosures in these interviews may be her most powerful and unrecognized legacy. Her honesty helped chip away at the stigma surrounding <a href=#>mental health</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>encouraged others to get help</a>. It is not an exaggeration to say that thousands of people changed their lives because Diana talked about hers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, nearly <a href=# rel=noopener>one in six adults</a> in the U.K. and <a href=# rel=noopener>one in five adults</a> in the U.S. live with a <a href=#>mental illness</a>. Millions in the <a href=# rel=noopener>U.K. </a>and <a href=# rel=noopener>the U.S. </a>currently have an eating disorder, which is often accompanied by <a href=# rel=noopener>depression</a> or <a href=# rel=noopener>an anxiety disorder</a>. But only a relatively <a href=# rel=noopener>small percentage of people</a> will actually seek treatment. One of the biggest barriers is not access to help, but rather <a href=# rel=noopener>fear, shame and embarrassment</a>. While a number of celebrities, including <a href=#>Demi Lovato </a>and <a href=# rel=noopener>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, have spoken out about living with mental illness in recent years, such frank disclosures were far less typical when Diana first opened up about her life experiences.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even more unexpected was the <a href=# rel=noopener>clarity, honesty and depth with which Diana described her bulimia.</a> “That’s like a secret disease,” she told the BBC in that 1995 interview. “You inflict it upon yourself because your self-esteem is at a low ebb, and you don’t think you’re worthy or valuable. You fill your stomach up four or five times a day — some do it more — and it gives you a feeling of comfort.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s like having a pair of arms around you,” she added, “but it’s temporarily, temporary.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She said that she often came home from her official engagements “feeling pretty empty” and that she felt immense pressure to keep her marriage together <a href=#>despite the couple’s well-documented problems. </a>“I was crying out for help, but giving the wrong signals, and people were using my bulimia as a coat on a hanger: they decided that was the problem — Diana was unstable,” she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For people who don’t understand why someone would feel compelled to binge and purge, Diana’s shockingly vulnerable explanations provided a simple answer. Binging, she said, functioned as a release valve for pressures and problems that seemed otherwise insurmountable. The <a href=#>stigma surrounding mental health</a> can often be exacerbated by a lack of knowledge, and Diana’s candid interview allowed others to empathize and understand what it’s like to live with bulimia.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diana’s disclosure had even more value for people with first-hand experience with bulimia. During the second half of the 20th century, <a href=# rel=noopener>rates of bulimia</a> in Western, industrialized nations <a href=# rel=noopener>rose dramatically</a>. Yet many women viewed <a href=#>bulimia</a> as a private and deeply humiliating experience <a href=# rel=noopener>that should be kept hidden</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Remarkably, in the years during which Diana spoke publicly about her bulimia, <a href=# rel=noopener>rates of women</a> seeking treatment for bulimia in Great Britain<a href=# rel=noopener> more than doubled.</a> The press dubbed this <a href=# rel=noopener>phenomenon the “Diana effect.”</a> Mental health practitioners <a href=# rel=noopener>credited</a> this shift to greater public awareness and dialogue about bulimia, as well as women identifying with Diana. If a <i>princess</i> could be bulimic, so could they. If she could explain why she hurt herself, they could recognize that side of themselves too. If she could <a href=# rel=noopener>overcome</a> her eating disorder, they could too.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Self-disclosures, particularly of people in positions of power or visibility, can change how other people approach their own psychological health. Researchers <a href=# rel=noopener>have found</a> that knowing someone else with a mental illness can encourage others to get help. “It is notable that the Princess’s death in 1997 coincided with the beginning of the decline in bulimia incidence,” researchers <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote</a> in a 2005 study published in the <i>British Journal of Psychiatry</i> on time trends in eating disorder incidences. “Identification with a public figure’s struggle with bulimia might have temporarily decreased the shame associated with the illness, and encouraged women to seek help for the first time.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unfortunately, after Diana’s death in 1997, those <a href=# rel=noopener>rates slowly returned</a> to baseline. By 2000, the “Diana effect” had vanished. Currently, in the United States, we are in the throes of a new <a href=#>mental health</a> crisis. A study published in <i>Pediatrics</i> last year found that between 2005 and 2014, there was a 37% increase in the number of individuals aged 12-20 <a href=#>reporting a major depressive episode</a>. But there hasn’t been a corresponding rise in treatment rates.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hopefully, the 20th anniversary of Diana’s death will reignite conversations about why it’s so important to speak openly about mental health and encourage others to seek help. Her sons have already <a href=#>taken up that task</a>. Earlier this year, Prince Harry <a href=# rel=noopener>spoke frankly</a> about seeking counseling to address his grief over his mother’s death. Meanwhile, Prince William <a href=# rel=noopener>appeared</a> in a documentary about <a href=#>anorexia</a>, where he discussed his mother’s experience with bulimia.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We need to normalize the conversation about mental health,” Prince William said in the documentary. “We need to be matter-of-fact about it, and not hide it in the dark where it festers.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Diana did not set out to be a mental health advocate. She simply told her truth and her narrative resonated. These days, we could use more truth-tellers like her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i><a href=# rel=noopener>Jane Mendle</a> is a clinical psychologist and associate professor at Cornell University.
