Besides her relationship with Johnny Depp,<strong> she also dated photographer </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Tasya van Ree</strong></a><strong> in&nbsp;2008. In&nbsp;2010, she publicly came out as&nbsp;bisexual. </strong>Reflecting on&nbsp;her decision to&nbsp;come out, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> that: “[It] did impact my&nbsp;career, it&nbsp;was difficult.

Amber acknowledges it&nbsp;as&nbsp;“a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beautiful relationship</a>. We&nbsp;just bonded on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things that speak to&nbsp;who I&nbsp;am on&nbsp;the inside. I&nbsp;have so&nbsp;much respect for him.”</p><p>Amber’s romantic journey reflects the complexities and fluctuations that can come with relationships. From her public coming out to&nbsp;navigating high-profile romances, <strong>Amber has faced both criticism and admiration. Through it&nbsp;all, she remains true to&nbsp;herself and values the connections she has made along the way.</strong></p><p><h2>She has a&nbsp;daughter but prefers to&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;low profile.</h2></p><p><strong>Amber’s joy expanded in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big way with the arrival of&nbsp;her daughter, </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Oonagh Paige</strong></a><strong>, born on&nbsp;April&nbsp;8, 2021.</strong> The actress pleasantly surprised her fans by&nbsp;sharing a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;her daughter on&nbsp;Instagram, expressing her excitement.</p><p>“I’m so&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;share this news with you. Four years ago, I&nbsp;decided&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;child. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own terms. <strong>I&nbsp;now appreciate how radical it&nbsp;is&nbsp;for&nbsp;us as&nbsp;women to&nbsp;think about one of&nbsp;the most fundamental parts of&nbsp;our destinies in&nbsp;this way,” </strong>she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>For Amber, Oonagh represents the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new chapter, and she cherishes the idea of&nbsp;shaping the rest of&nbsp;her life alongside her daughter. Although the identity of&nbsp;Oonagh’s father remains unknown, Amber shares her perspective on&nbsp;the matter, expressing hope for a&nbsp;time when it’s normalized for women to&nbsp;choose motherhood without societal expectations.</p><p>“<strong>She’s the beginning of&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. </strong>I&nbsp;hope we&nbsp;arrive at&nbsp;a&nbsp;point in&nbsp;which it’s normalized to&nbsp;not want a&nbsp;ring to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;crib. A&nbsp;part of&nbsp;me&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;uphold that my&nbsp;private life is&nbsp;none of&nbsp;anyone’s business. I&nbsp;also get that the nature of&nbsp;my&nbsp;job compels me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take control of&nbsp;this.”</p><p>However, Amber remains adamant about keeping certain aspects of&nbsp;her private life just that—private. She emphasizes that her personal choices are her business, and strives to&nbsp;strike a&nbsp;balance between protecting her privacy and meeting the demands of&nbsp;her public-facing profession. Consequently, she shares glimpses of&nbsp;her life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother, carefully covering her daughter’s face in&nbsp;photos to&nbsp;maintain their privacy in&nbsp;the public eye.
