Following a touching father-daughter moment, the coaches decided to let a contestant audition after already seeing her face.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-australia-bends-the-rules-for-shenae-watson>The Voice Australia Bends the Rules for Shenae Watson</h2><p>During Sunday’s season premiere, Chris Watson sang “Jessie’s Girl” by Rick Springfield for his Blind Audition. He didn’t turn any of the coaches’ chairs, but Chris said he wanted to inspire his daughter Shenae to “keep having a crack.”</p><p>Chris said Shenae — who was standing to the side of the stage — is a “bloody good” singer, which made the coaches want to hear her. However, coach Guy Sebastian was unsure about letting Shenae perform on the show, explaining, “If you’re actually really good, then we won’t be able to put you through, ’cause we’re not supposed to see you.”</p><p>Shenae said that after seeing her dad audition, she was willing to give it a try. Host Sonia Kruger said she would “check upstairs” about whether Shenae would be allowed to audition for this season. She came back to say, “Shenae can come back to audition, but coaches, you won’t know when she’s going to appear.”</p><p>Before Chris and his family left, coach <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rita Ora</a> said he seemed like “the most incredible dad, and the nicest man.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE AUSTRALIA’ PREVIEWS NEW COACH JASON DERULO’S FIRST SEASON</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shenae-turns-four-chairs-with-chandelier-performance>Shenae Turns Four Chairs with ‘Chandelier’ Performance</h3><p>Shenae returned to the Voice Australia stage later to perform “Chandelier” by Sia. Before her performance, she explained, “I’ve always loved singing. But after a couple of knockbacks, it really took a shot at my confidence.” Shenae said she wanted to make her dad proud with her audition.</p><p>The 21-year-old turned out to be an incredible vocalist. Once she reached the song’s chorus, Jason Derulo immediately turned his chair. Sebastian and Ora followed soon after. Jessica Mauboy then made Shenae a four-chair turn.</p><p>Chris could be seen wiping away tears as he watched his daughter perform. The coaches were also emotional over the moment, with Derulo saying, “I’m not a crier, but that got me.” Ora called the situation a “complete win for the whole family.”</p><p>When it came time to choose whose team she would join, Shenae chose Sebastian as her coach.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kelly-Clarkson-Las-Vegas1-220x159.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson Puts Empowering Twist on ‘Piece by Piece’ Lyrics Post-Divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice Australia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecCuqq2qkaG2onnBnqWdq12ptaZ50a6jnqtdlrO1sdFmq6itk522r7OMn5itoJWneqWt1KCfrZ2iYrqwucSnq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
