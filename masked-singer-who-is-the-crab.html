And one of the biggest ones is the addition of Wildcards. The Crab came onto the stage with a tragic backstory, but a triumphant voice. He is definitely here to stay!</strong></p><p id=block-8cd58f3a-f40d-4cb7-a343-93e1db5313c1>But which celebrity is under the Crab mask? Let’s break down all the clues that lead to our Wildcard prediction.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=block-bba56fdc-1613-4f63-a943-7d4ef6fb3cee>Clues on The Masked Singer Season 5</h4><p>The first set of clues for a Crab started with him saying, “all my life I’ve dreamed of being a star.” He was blessed that his dream came true “in a flash.” Crab claimed, “Everyone in the world wanted to be like me. I felt like a king crab.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-826093eb-7e1a-4dd7-a946-3dce54548dda><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER SEASON 5 GROUP B WILDCARD ROUND RECAP</a></strong></p><p>But with every blessing he got, tragedy seemed to follow. Darkness has followed him and his family. A broken mirror floats across the screen. Crab says he and his family have endured “so many twists, turns, and traumas” while his claws are being wrapped up. A calculator with 2+3 on it is shown. Crab says it’s the love of his family that gives him strength. The Mona Lisa is seen underwater. His first song was a tribute to the family members who went before him. The Bee and Butterfly from earlier seasons of The Masked Singer appear in the clues. Crab closes the clues by saying it’s “finally time to let the light back in.”</p><p>After his performance, he admitted his first crush was Janet Jackson.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=block-aed0ca83-5ae3-4549-9411-272b33f78a6d>Popular Guesses for The Masked Singer Crab</h4><p>The panelists have guessed that the Crab could be Lenny Kravitz, Bobby Brown, or Johnny Gill. Surprisingly, fans online seem to agree with Ken for once, thinking he’s Bobby Brown. Other popular options that fans have thrown out as options are Tracy Morgan or Randy Jackson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is The Crab on The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-368e3453-5d4b-4448-a575-0fe21bda999f>That voice is so familiar! And paired with all the clues about tragedy and trauma, the Crab can only be one person. And The Masked Singer Crab is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p id=block-eb4a6776-9b31-44f2-8abe-d267d1b20c62><strong>Bobby Brown!</strong></p><p id=block-1b37ce66-508a-4e79-b1db-eb10a82e0a2f>Yes, now all of the clues and his voice just make sense. No other celebrity I can think of has experienced the loss that Bobby Brown has. Between his parents dying within a year of each other, the recent loss of a son and daughter, and the very public passing of his former wife Whitney Houston, Bobby has been through it all. This redemption arc is the perfect way for him shine light in the darkness.</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-b48d7fb3-c871-4726-9e94-88c63344529a><strong>FOR MORE CLUES DECODED: <a href=#>RACCOON</a> | <a href=#>RUSSIAN DOLLS</a> | <a href=#>ROBOPINE</a> | <a href=#>THE PIGLET</a> | <a href=#>BLACK SWAN</a> | <a href=#>CHAMELEON</a> | <a href=#>SEASHELL</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>GRANDPA MONSTER</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>ORCA</a></strong></p><p id=block-a766f1a5-e470-49e0-9f5f-a94403f9a903>In the clues, Crab mentioned his dreams came true “in a flash.” Bobby Brown is also known as Flash B. That’s also accurate to Bobby Brown, who started as part of New Edition, which has five members (as seen in the “2+3” calculator). He said he felt “like a king crab,” which points to him being the self-proclaimed “King of R&B.” Bobby has also released an album called “King of Stage.” The Mona Lisa alludes to another album of his, “The Masterpiece.” The Bee and Butterfly are a nod to his initials, BB. Finally, his first crush being Janet Jackson completely checks out. Bobby Brown has said that he was in love with her!</p><p id=block-b059d09d-9b41-40c0-a5c4-c7c0ffec307f>Do you agree with our prediction? Or are there any clues we missed?
