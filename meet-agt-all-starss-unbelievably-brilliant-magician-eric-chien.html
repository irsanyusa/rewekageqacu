The accomplished illusionist is undeniably one of the most iconic to ever appear on the Got Talent stage. As he returns to the America’s Got Talent stage for AGT All-Stars he’s set to offer more and convince the crowd that he could make the impossible, unbelievably possible.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eric-chien-found-peace-in-magic-amid-his-teenage-misery>Eric Chien Found Peace in Magic Amid His Teenage Misery</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Chien</a> suffered bullying a very young age, being the only Asian in a Western-oriented academe. Apparently, he’s been beaten up several times that he had to transfer schools four to five times so he could be safe from mean kids in class.</p><p>When Eric reached high school, he ignited his interest and passion for magic. At 16, he decided to be a magician and has committed to that dream ever since. Magic tricks have become Eric’s best friend during tough times, saving him from the cruel reality of his surroundings.</p><p>Eric does not imitate the usual tricks that many magicians employ. He creates his own techniques, making his routines unique and more entertaining. As days go by, Eric has mustered enough confidence to show off his talent in front of a huge audience. Yet, his original plans had to take a backseat because he was called back to Taiwan to serve the military in 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Has Become an AGT Powerhouse Magician Over the Years</h2><p>When he came out of military service, he had to pick the pieces of the identity he lost at the time. Subsequently, he appeared stronger and ready to show what he’s got. In 2018, he landed first place in the FISM Grand Prix. He then flew abroad to join Asia’s Got Talent 2019, snatching another win.</p><p>After this success, Eric then stepped in the America’s Got Talent stage to showcase more. He was seemingly obvious during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">audition</a>, but he nevertheless delivered a foolproof performance. His act consisted of changing the colors of his cards and creating the illusion that they’re being cut up and put back together with a ribbon. This incredibly good act and his following performances secured him a spot in the show until the Semifinals.</p><p>In 2022, Eric joined two more Got Talent competitions —China’s Got Talent and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent: The Ultimate Magician</a>. He reached the Finale of the former and successfully sealed the gold in the latter. This groundbreaking history has made him one of the four acts to have won Got Talent twice.</p><p>Last November, Erich <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>announced</a> that he’s among the 60 talented acts competing in AGT All-Stars. This is his fifth attempt in Got Talent and might be his third win if he gets lucky enough.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_PriyankaChopra_Amy-SussmanGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Nick Jonas, Priyanka Chopra Publicly Debut Baby Daughter Malti" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRnMFurculZKyskafAtHnUp5mepJmaw6Kuy7Jkm6qZobmqrc2tZKaZl56wqq3NZpyroZNisKm1xKdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
