They can squish themselves and get into hard-to-reach places, which is&nbsp;why slugs can often be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the most unlikely spaces, like under tree bark or&nbsp;inside tiny crevices, or&nbsp;at&nbsp;the library pretending to&nbsp;study for exams. Snails, on&nbsp;the other hand, are tightly connected with their shells and can’t survive without one.</p><p>Unlike hermit crabs, which replace their shells as&nbsp;they grow, snails are born with a&nbsp;shell on&nbsp;their back. Baby snails look adorable with those fragile translucent bubbles that calcify and become bigger and tougher with age. Cute. Many of&nbsp;the snails’ internal organs are inside the shell too, meaning if&nbsp;it&nbsp;gets crushed or&nbsp;damaged, the animal would probably not survive. Still, a&nbsp;snail can repair small scratches and cracks in&nbsp;the shell with the help of&nbsp;proteins and <a href=# title=calcium data-link=tag>calcium</a> secreted by&nbsp;its mantle.</p><p>Turtles are very close to&nbsp;snails in&nbsp;this regard, by&nbsp;the way, because, contrary to&nbsp;the common myth, they can’t leave their shell at&nbsp;a&nbsp;whim either. A&nbsp;turtle’s shell is&nbsp;an&nbsp;integral part of&nbsp;its body, and despite the reptile being able to&nbsp;hide its head and paws inside to&nbsp;protect itself from predators, its skeleton is&nbsp;fused with the hard shell. And just like any other animal’s skeleton, it&nbsp;grows with the turtle itself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/2b6/85f/a9259d5922975b82127b6c05c9.jpeg><p>Koalas do&nbsp;only eat eucalyptus leaves, but there are over 600 different kinds of&nbsp;those. And koalas only munch on&nbsp;30! Or&nbsp;just&nbsp;5% of&nbsp;what’s available on&nbsp;the <a href=# title=menu data-link=tag>menu</a>. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;very specific eucalyptus tree to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;good meal for a&nbsp;picky koala. These adorable creatures also have something in&nbsp;common with domestic cats: they sleep for 18–20 hours a&nbsp;day.</p><p>Polar bears aren’t at&nbsp;all white. Their <a href=# title=skin data-link=tag>skin</a> is&nbsp;black under the fur. They need white color to&nbsp;disguise themselves while on&nbsp;the hunt. The color black absorbs the sun better than any other, while white fur doesn’t stop sunlight. Rays pass right through&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;sense, a&nbsp;polar bear has transparent fur.</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;myth that cats and dogs see the world in&nbsp;black and white. In&nbsp;reality, they just can’t distinguish some colors. Nobody knows how exactly dogs see. Some think they only distinguish two colors. Could be&nbsp;blue and yellow, for all we&nbsp;know. But they can see shades of&nbsp;other colors better than people! And cats have wonderful night vision. They need about 7&nbsp;times less light than a&nbsp;human to&nbsp;see in&nbsp;the dark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/fb8/f9c/1462fc5242b9bc77c8be691785.jpeg><p>Giraffes were thought to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mute. But recently, it’s been found that they make low-frequency sounds at&nbsp;night to&nbsp;communicate with each other. During the day, they don’t say a&nbsp;word and warn each other of&nbsp;danger in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very unusual way: by&nbsp;moving their well-developed eyebrows. It’s likely that at&nbsp;night it’s difficult to&nbsp;see the eyebrows, so&nbsp;they start talking for real.</p><p>While we’re on&nbsp;the topic of&nbsp;giraffes, these animals sleep much more than 30&nbsp;minutes a&nbsp;day&nbsp;— but probably not as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you&nbsp;do. Their sleeping pattern is&nbsp;quite typical. After researchers monitored a&nbsp;herd of&nbsp;giraffes, they found out they slept at&nbsp;night and took short naps in&nbsp;the afternoon. In&nbsp;total, each giraffe had around<strong> 5&nbsp;hours of&nbsp;sleep every day</strong>. And by&nbsp;the way, a&nbsp;herd of&nbsp;these guys is&nbsp;actually known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“tower” of&nbsp;giraffes. Makes sense with the long necks.</p><p>Seagulls can drink saltwater. There are salt-secreting glands near their eyes. These glands purify seawater very quickly. And the salty residue comes out through the nostrils. Yep, you guess&nbsp;it. Salty snot.</p><p>The <strong>Adélie penguins</strong> are real romantics. They have only one partner for life. The male must give a&nbsp;smooth stone to&nbsp;the female to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;family. You could say that’s kind of&nbsp;an&nbsp;engagement ring. Like humans, though, a&nbsp;female penguin may refuse and not accept the gift. Hmm!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a41/370/9a464d52cf8373b277c72655be.jpeg><p>Speaking of&nbsp;animal love, foxes are romantic too. Male foxes are good fathers and husbands. They are devoted to&nbsp;their loved ones for life. They look after the females and even pick out fleas from their fur. Male foxes improve their hole-houses and take an&nbsp;active part in&nbsp;their babies’ upbringing.</p><p>Dolphins can sleep with one eye closed and the other one open. Half of&nbsp;the brain dreams and rests, and the second half closely monitors the environment for signs of&nbsp;danger. The perfect brain for sleeping during boring classes and meetings. Hey, I&nbsp;didn’t say that. Besides, dolphins manually control their breathing. They can simply drown if&nbsp;their whole brain is&nbsp;sleeping.</p><p><strong>Sea otters</strong> are the cutest sleepers among all animals. In&nbsp;summer, because of&nbsp;the heat, sea otters spend all the time in&nbsp;water. They swim on&nbsp;their backs and sleep in&nbsp;that position. The babies are sleeping on&nbsp;their mother’s stomach. And two adults hold each other by&nbsp;the paws so&nbsp;that they’re not carried apart by&nbsp;water currents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/3a0/0af/e1843e5e8da5db171f196aa052.jpeg><p>Ostriches don’t stick their heads in&nbsp;the sand when threatened. In&nbsp;fact, these guys don’t bury their heads at&nbsp;all. This myth has spread thanks to&nbsp;that famous idiom&nbsp;— “to&nbsp;hide one’s head in&nbsp;the sand.” In&nbsp;real life, ostriches have to&nbsp;dig holes in&nbsp;the sand for their eggs because they’re flightless birds. To&nbsp;make sure they’re evenly heated, ostriches put their heads in&nbsp;there to&nbsp;rotate the eggs from time to&nbsp;time. But ostriches still have some escaping mentality. When they face some threat, they can flop to&nbsp;the sand and stay perfectly still, pretending they aren’t alive.</p><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular misbelief, sharks can breathe only while moving because swimming helps them push water over their gills. Although many kinds of&nbsp;sharks are designed this way, many others&nbsp;— like bottom-dwelling nurse sharks&nbsp;— don’t need swimming to&nbsp;pump oxygen-rich water over their gills. Meanwhile, all sharks do&nbsp;lack swim bladders. So, if&nbsp;they stop swimming, they’ll probably sink to&nbsp;the bottom. But luckily, a&nbsp;shark’s body can’t be&nbsp;compressed. That’s why rapid descents or&nbsp;ascents are safe for them.</p><p>Scientists from Japan played audio recordings for cats to&nbsp;prove they’re truly dismissive. In&nbsp;those recordings, the owners of&nbsp;the cats called them by&nbsp;their names. Cats’ pupils dilated, the animals moved their tails, legs, or&nbsp;ears. Cats heard people, but rarely responded. It’s all about evolution&nbsp;— cats came to&nbsp;people because they were attracted by&nbsp;mice that ate grains. They lived close to&nbsp;people, but were never tamed. And yet, we&nbsp;keep feeding them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c39/053/df8327542fa43551bb38113a83.jpeg><p>Birds are actually the only surviving dinosaurs. They evolved from theropods, the dinosaurs that ran on&nbsp;two legs. Yep, T. rex is&nbsp;a&nbsp;distant relative of&nbsp;chickens, ostriches, and even hummingbirds. In&nbsp;reality, flamingos are white. The bird turns pink due to&nbsp;beta-carotene. This pigment is&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the algae and the shrimp that it&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;on. You can change your skin color too. If&nbsp;you eat a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;carrots, your skin will turn slightly orange. This will happen because of&nbsp;the high beta-carotene content in&nbsp;the vegetable.</p><p>Sailors from all over the world talked about the giant squid they met on&nbsp;their voyages. For many years, scientists considered monsters with long tentacles to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;myth. But in&nbsp;2004, the first photo of&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant squid was taken. They actually exist. Scientists have registered an&nbsp;animal that has grown to&nbsp;43&nbsp;ft.</p><p>Mosquitoes actually bite some people more than others. The most delicious humans are those with type&nbsp;O blood. Also, these insects have really good eyesight. They’re attracted by&nbsp;green, black, and red colors, so&nbsp;check the color of&nbsp;your clothes before you go&nbsp;camping!</p><p>You can actually put a&nbsp;shark in&nbsp;a&nbsp;trance for 15&nbsp;minutes. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you need to&nbsp;stroke the nose of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dangerous animal with your hand. This sort of&nbsp;hypnosis is&nbsp;called tonic immobility that happens thanks to&nbsp;the receptors in&nbsp;the shark’s nose. When stroked, the receptors send a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;signals, and the shark’s brain is&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;process them all. What it&nbsp;doesn’t say here, is&nbsp;exactly how you get close enough to&nbsp;a&nbsp;shark to&nbsp;rub its nose. I’d say that’s important information, don’t you think?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/218/53b/93d56250f19df04fc60ad047a4.jpeg><p>Elephants aren’t afraid of&nbsp;mice per&nbsp;se. But these massive animals have bad vision. They also move fairly slowly. That’s why they can get startled by&nbsp;a&nbsp;bird or&nbsp;a&nbsp;small creature (like a&nbsp;mouse) darting past them. Just the element of&nbsp;surprise, nothing more.</p><p>The chameleon can change its color. But this creature doesn’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;camouflage itself. The color change helps the animal regulate its temperature and communicate with peers.</p><p>When most dogs pant, their tongues hang out of&nbsp;their mouths. That’s why many people think that’s how they sweat. In&nbsp;reality, dogs’ sweat glands are located on&nbsp;their paw pads. Plus, there are other sweat glands all over their bodies. Dogs pant to&nbsp;evaporate moisture from their nasal passages, tongues, and the lining of&nbsp;their lungs. This also helps to&nbsp;cool them down.</p><p>You might leave wasps alone, but don’t be&nbsp;so&nbsp;sure they’ll do&nbsp;the same. Bees DO&nbsp;respect human boundaries, and if&nbsp;you don’t bother them, they won’t hurt you. But wasps are so&nbsp;bad-tempered they can sting you even if&nbsp;you’re just walking by&nbsp;their nest. Well, phooey on&nbsp;them!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCvrcilqmabkaN6rbHAr5xmrJiatrN50qGcpaSjYq6vsIyoq6GdomK6usDHrGSamp%2BqwW6tzaKkmqSjYoVygo9tb2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
