A&nbsp;keyhole cut at&nbsp;the back showed a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;Pippa’s skin, which <strong>spiced up&nbsp;an&nbsp;otherwise modest bridal look</strong>. Pippa’s dress was long and high at&nbsp;the front, so&nbsp;showing a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;her back was just about right and suited the occasion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d6/0f6/1d9f4f52a2a1734f1a7ee45266.jpg><p><h2>The wedding gown of&nbsp;Priyanka Chopra paid a&nbsp;sentimental tribute to&nbsp;her husband and parents.</h2></p><p>During her wedding to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Nick Jonas" data-link=tag>Nick Jonas</a>, <a href=# title="Priyanka Chopra" data-link=tag>Priyanka Chopra</a> wore several dresses. For the western wedding ceremony, she donned a&nbsp;hand-beaded wedding <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> with intricate details by&nbsp;Ralph Lauren. Priyanka wanted her dress to&nbsp;<strong>honor sentimental moments and meaningful people</strong> of&nbsp;her life, so&nbsp;the designers hand-stitched Nick’s full name, the names of&nbsp;the bride’s parents, and the wedding date on&nbsp;the dress. Priyanka also added a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;the lace from her mother-in-law’s dress to&nbsp;her own gown.</p><p><h2>The wedding dress of&nbsp;Princess Eugenie sent a&nbsp;message of&nbsp;support.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/895/5af/aa78895191b3943bbdfc5ec408.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;12, Princess Eugenie underwent surgery that corrected her scoliosis. The scar remained, and on&nbsp;her wedding day, Eugenie didn’t want to&nbsp;hide&nbsp;it. Instead, she asked designers to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;<strong>dress with a&nbsp;low back that showcased her scar</strong>. “For&nbsp;me, it’s a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;communicating with people who are going through either similar situations with scoliosis or&nbsp;having a&nbsp;scar of&nbsp;their own they are trying to&nbsp;deal with,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> the princess.</p><p><h2>Ellie Goulding had her own initials and those of&nbsp;her future husband’s embroidered on&nbsp;her dress.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b1/348/a7dd615d9e9c0e2ed307499ec2.jpg><p>On&nbsp;the day of&nbsp;her wedding, Ellie Goulding donned a&nbsp;long-sleeved hand-embroidered <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> with a&nbsp;high collar. The organza collar and the silk tulle veil had <strong>the bride and groom’s initials embroidered</strong> on&nbsp;them. This fine handwork took designers 591&nbsp;hours.</p><p><h2>Hilary Duff opted for embroidered initials on&nbsp;her dress too.</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Hilary Duff" data-link=tag>Hilary Duff</a> is&nbsp;another bride who liked the idea of&nbsp;having <strong>her husband’s and her own initials commemorated</strong> on&nbsp;her wedding dress. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a>, which was designed by&nbsp;Jenny Packham, looked quite modern thanks to&nbsp;saddle-shaped voluminous shoulder pads and long sleeves that touched the floor.</p><p><h2>The wedding outfit of&nbsp;Princess Diana was meant to&nbsp;bring her good luck.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e85/eec/99249654599a2c168cc731e1ff.jpg><p>Following an&nbsp;old tradition, on&nbsp;her wedding day, Diana <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wore</a> <strong>something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue</strong>. “Something old” was a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;antique lace from Queen Mary, “something new” was the dress itself, “something borrowed” was the Spencer tiara Diana was wearing on&nbsp;her head, and a&nbsp;bow sewn in&nbsp;the dress bodice played the role of&nbsp;“something blue.”</p><p>There was also a&nbsp;hidden <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>charm</a> that was supposed to&nbsp;bring the bride good luck: a&nbsp;golden horseshoe decorated with diamonds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41f/eaa/30757058b3aaa3c1e74553471f.jpg><p><h2>The train of&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II’s dress was symbolic.</h2></p><p>The wedding of&nbsp;Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II) and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of&nbsp;Edinburgh, took place right after World War II. The fan-shaped 13-foot long <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>train</a> embroidered with <a href=# title=flowers data-link=tag>flowers</a> symbolized rebirth and growth after the war. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that this design was inspired by&nbsp;Botticelli’s painting, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Primavera</a>.</p><p><h2>The wedding dress of&nbsp;Kate Moss showed affection for her favorite designer.</h2></p><p>The vintage-style dress <a href=# title="Kate Moss" data-link=tag>Kate Moss</a> donned on&nbsp;her wedding day was designed by&nbsp;John Galliano. Kate chose John as&nbsp;her bridal gown designer after numerous times of&nbsp;her wearing his creations on&nbsp;catwalks throughout her modeling career. Kate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> her choice, saying, “<strong>I’ve lived in&nbsp;his dresses for years</strong>, and they just make me&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;comfortable.”</p><p><h2>Queen Victoria was one of&nbsp;the first women to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;white wedding dress.</h2></p><p>Queen Victoria is&nbsp;often credited for <strong>starting the tradition of&nbsp;donning white dresses</strong> for weddings. Even though she was not the first royal who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> in&nbsp;white, her choice influenced bridal fashion. Following in&nbsp;the footsteps of&nbsp;the queen, many fashionable and wealthy brides switched to&nbsp;the white color when designing their bridal gowns.</p><p><h2>Grace Kelly set a&nbsp;bridal fashion trend that is&nbsp;still loved today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f6/620/4069ed5690a2849d6cf4ccc167.jpg><p>We’ll never learn if&nbsp;it’s true or&nbsp;not, but it&nbsp;looks like Grace Kelly’s wedding dress has some magical powers. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> with a&nbsp;fitted lace bodice and a&nbsp;tulip-shaped skirt that the future Princess of&nbsp;Monaco donned on&nbsp;her special day enchanted so&nbsp;many brides around the globe that it&nbsp;still remains one of&nbsp;the most famous and <strong>most recreated wedding dresses</strong> in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>It&nbsp;looks like some celebrity brides also got inspired by&nbsp;Grace Kelly’s bridal outfit.
