I think that you have more options with men also. I’m single now!”</p><p>The Griselda star, who is currently single, admits that she thinks NYC offers more options when it comes to dating, compared to Los Angeles. She agreed with Fallon that New York also boasts great restaurants for dating.</p><p>Vergara’s positive comments about New York City’s dating pool come as she is going through a divorce from actor Joe Manganiello after seven years of marriage. The couple announced their split in July 2022, citing irreconcilable differences. In November, the newly single Vergara was spotted out on a dinner date with LA-based orthopedic surgeon Justin Saliman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-vergara-shared-the-reason-her-relationship-with-joe-manganiello-ended>Sofía Vergara Shared The Reason Her Relationship With Joe Manganiello Ended</h2><p>Vergara and Manganiello confirmed their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">separation</a> last July, citing “irreconcilable differences.” They had one of the most talked-about and unexpected breakups of 2023.</p><p>According to the documents they submitted to the courts, the former couple cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their separation. Almost half a year later, the Modern Family star has revealed why she and the actor decided to go their separate ways.</p><p>“I am a recently divorced woman. My marriage broke down because my husband was younger, wanted to have children, and I didn’t want to be an old mom. I feel it’s not fair to the baby,” she said.</p><p>In a departure from her usual reserve regarding personal matters, the actress displayed a newfound openness, particularly when sharing her perspectives on motherhood.</p><p>“That’s not for me anymore. I had a child at 19, and I’m ready to embrace the role of a grandmother, not a mother,” Vergara said, alluding to her 32-year-old son, Manolo González-Ripoll Vergara.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-qualities-of-her-ideal-partner>The Qualities of Her Ideal Partner</h2><p>Now that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vergara</a> has revealed the reasons behind her separation from Manganiello, her recent statements about what she looks for in a partner make even more sense. During her appearance on the Spanish show El Hormiguero, the actress listed some qualities her prospective partner should have.</p><p>“He has to be around my age, in his fifties like me, he has to have kids – I’m 51 – and he has to be good-looking, but not necessarily gorgeous, maybe an actor, not too much,” she said.</p><p>She also specified her preferences regarding financial matters with her ideal partner.</p><p>“I’ve said it many times: he has to be equal to or have more money than me,” she said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_TaylorSwift_TravisKelce_Gotham_GC-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce Reportedly Will Get Engaged This Summer According to Sources" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qidopldq7Kzs8CrmGaqlauyorjSZqqhnV2srq%2FA0marqGWjqa66ecinZKexk2K5sLrGnqlmmpWYrra%2FxGamn2WjnruouMRmpJ6mXa68tnnHmq2eZZ2kv6Z5zqmroqeeqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
