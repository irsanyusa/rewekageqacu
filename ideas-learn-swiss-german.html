Alas, Swiss German is not one of them. While German, French, Italian and Romansh reflect the historical connections of the small country with its neighbors, Swiss German is the spoken language of a big part of the German-speaking portions of Switzerland. In fact, Swiss German is not a language, but a standardized form of a group of Alemannic dialects. This means it is rather close to standard German. Furthermore,most people in Switzerland are fluent in German, and you might ask yourself why you should even bother with a language that makes abundant use of notoriously difficult sounds such as ch (like in German acht), ü or ä. Well, Swiss German comes with some advantages, too, that make learning easy and fun. Here is how to learn it.</p><li><a href=#>Take language classes</a></li><li><a href=#>Sing along to music</a></li><li><a href=#>Listen to the radio</a></li><li><a href=#>Watch TV</a></li><li><a href=#>Cook and bake</a></li><li><a href=#>Make friends</a></li><li><a href=#>Good night in Swiss German&nbsp;and other words</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Take-language-classes>1. Take language classes</h2><p>How hard is it to learn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swiss German</a>? While the distinct pronunciation of many popular sounds in Swiss German might put you off from learning the language at first, you should consider two things: First,Swiss German is a rather <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">easy language </a>to learn for German speakers. After all, it is a group of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German dialects</a>. You already know most of the vocabulary and grammar of Swiss German. Even better, the reasonable Swiss spared themselves a lot of the complications of the standard German: no <a href=#>ß</a>, just the perfect tense and no simple past, one diminutive –li instead of –lein (Wäägli for German Wäglein – small cart) or –chen (Müüsli for German Mäuschen – small mouse), no –n at the end of the infinitive (läbe for German leben – to live, ich läb(e) for German ich lebe – I live) and in the middle of compound words and no diphthongs, to name a few. And you can try to remember the right <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> and mumble it instead We’ll show you how to learn Swiss German fast.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Sing-along-to-music>2. Sing along to music</h2><p>Melody and rhythm help us memorize new vocabulary in context. So check out artists like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mani Matter</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Airbäg </a>and join them in singing in Swiss German. With time, you will get the pronunciation right and be able to impress your friends <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">talking about music</a>. For bonus points, translate a song into standard German and think about the differences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Listen-to-the-radio>3. Listen to the radio</h2><p>A fun way to improve your listening comprehension and pronunciation is listening to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">radio</a>. Learn from the music and introduce yourself to bits of talk with the advertisements or the news. Then take it to the next level with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a>. You can even do this while doing the dishes or on your way to work.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Watch-TV>4. Watch TV</h2><p>If you feel a visual clue would help, turn on the TV. The context of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movie</a> makes understanding what is said so much easier, and even the gestures and facial expressions of the news speaker can help you. Still not enough? Follow the subtitles until you feel you don’t need them anymore.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Cook-and-bake>5. Cook and bake</h2><p>Explore the culinary side of your (potential) host country by taking to regional cuisine.

Make friends</h2><p>Friends are always good to have and especially helpful when you are new to a country. Socializing is also a good way to immerse yourself in the language. Speed up your learning while having fun. A good way to make friends is by joining a sports club or some other kind of organized activity. If you are shy, try a single word now and then. Greet them with Grüezi (hello) and say goodbye with Guet Nacht, which means good night in Swiss German.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Good night in Swiss German and other words&nbsp;</h2><p>For a quick start, try to learn these Swiss German words:</p><p>Merci vilmal – thanks a lot</p><p>Pröschtli! – Cheers!</p><p>Gömmer? – Shall we go?</p><p>Chuntsch? – Are you coming?</p><p>Kolleg/Kollegin – friend (male/female)</p><p>Hüüsli – toilet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How hard is it to learn Swiss German?</h2><p>Learning Swiss German may not be easy, but if you have a fair knowledge of standard German, you will get there. Indeed, you will have lots of fun doing so.
