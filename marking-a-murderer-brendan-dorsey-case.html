A federal judge <a href=# rel=noopener>overturned Brendan Dassey’s conviction</a> in Milwaukee on Friday. Here are five things to know about the story that captivated and divided the country earlier this year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Dassey and his uncle, Steven Avery, rocketed to fame when Netflix released Making a Murderer</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For a few weeks in early 2016, Dassey and Avery were the subject of intense debate over whether they murdered 25-year-old photographer Teresa Halbach. The show contended police officers charged the Wisconsin men for Halbach’s murder after Avery was exonerated for a sexual assault he did not commit. While other shows that detail the experiences of alleged criminals do not necessarily conclude if they are guilty or not, many said Making A Murderer left viewers feeling Dassey and Avery were innocent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Making a Murderer omitted key facts</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The show was made over the course of 10 years before its release in December 2015. To condense years of material into 10 episodes, the shows creators left out some information, including facts law enforcement officials argue were key to the conviction of Dassey and Avery. <a href=#>Among facts omitted from the series</a>: evidence that Avery knew Halbach, his DNA was found on her car and some jurors in the case had ties to the local sheriff’s department.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Thousands of people signed petitions calling for Dassey and Avery to be freed</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More than 129,000 people <a href=#>signed a petition</a> calling on President Obama to pardon the two men, while another petition drew more than 530,000 signatures. The White House responded by saying Obama does not have the power to pardon a state criminal offense. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who could pardon Dassey and Avery, <a href=# rel=noopener>said he would not interfere</a> in the judicial process.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>The series was not a documentary</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As TIME’s TV critic Daniel D’Addario wrote at the time, Making A Murderer was not intended to be a balanced, factual accounting of Avery and Dassey’s case. It was “true crime entertainment.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The show’s capaciousness makes the viewer feel both accomplished simply for having watched and like the lucky recipient of all the information there possibly could be to know about Steven Avery,” <a href=#>D’Addario wrote</a>, also noting that the show left out key information to tell its story. Last month, <a href=#>Netflix announced there will be a second season of the show</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Avery is still in prison</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As of now, Avery is still serving a life sentence for Halbach’s murder. He filed a petition for appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGVlhniDjqaYq6OZo7RurYymrKuclaeys3nBq5ynnJGjeqW70aycsmWTlsCmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
