On Wednesday evening, that place was the Los Angeles Federal Building, where someone captured and shared the internet’s latest object of desire – a youthful eight-foot tall statue of Abraham Lincoln that’s been on display since 1939.
In this irresistible depiction, casual Honest Abe strikes a pose sans shirt and sans shoes, holding a book in one hand, clutching the top of his low-slung trousers in the other, emanating beams of confidence."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s abundantly clear from his Indiana limestone and arms and granite rock hard abs that this statue is portraying a guy who worked out.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Young Lincoln statue first made its splashy debut at the New York World’s Fair in 1939, but as one astute Twitter user who loves art history points out, it’s never too late to be reminded of its existence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Reminder that the Los Angeles federal courthouse has a statue of Abraham Lincoln where he’s a shirtless young stud suggestively tugging at his waistband like a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model,” Zack Stentz wrote.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What is a sexy statue of Abraham Lincoln even doing here?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A student artist by the name of James Lee Hansen dreamed up the sculpture for a public art contest, which he won handsomely.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The biggest success story in modern sculpture is the story of James Lee Hansen of Los Angeles who is now carving an 8-foot statue of young Abraham Lincoln,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LIFE magazine</a> reported at the time in the text accompanied by a photo of the artist beside the statue. (The artist used himself as a model to sculpt the masterpiece, and wore short shorts and trendy sunglasses for the picture.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Well, from a sculpturing standpoint, it’s better to show the body without any clothes. That’s why I left ’em off,” Hansen explained at the time, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Art Archive</a>. People see your point, Hansen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The budding Rodin lived hard and he worked hard, earning a whopping $7,200 for his swole depiction of the 16th president. He purchased a car with his winnings, crashed it, and spent 18 days in jail, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LIFE</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though it’s not clear where his artistic ambitions took him after he cut this considerable figure, Hansen is still making his mark 80 years later.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All the “Gettysburg Undress” and “honest abs” jokes the internet can handle are rolling in.
