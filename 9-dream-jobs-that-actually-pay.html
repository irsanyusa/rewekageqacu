How did you get into yarn bombing?

I have had no formal art training, but I have always enjoyed street art and graffiti very much. The rebelliousness and the politics of street art have always resonated with me. When I saw photos of other individuals using knitting for projects in public, I fell in love with it immediately. I put up my first yarn bomb the very next day.</p><p><b>What’s the best part of your job?</b> Having the freedom to conceptualize projects on my own, and getting to see and hear the reactions of viewers. &nbsp;Usually I walk away from my work after I put up an installation, but I get to use social media to see photos of people with the project, hear people’s reaction to the work, and hear how a project was taken down.</p><p><b>What’s the worst part of your job?</b> The worst part of my job is that the commissions&nbsp;tend to be unreliable. &nbsp;I will receive a call about a project and find out a week, month, or months later that they aren’t interested anymore. &nbsp;It is as though they will lay a pile of money in front of me and then take it away. &nbsp;That can feel like an emotional&nbsp;roller coaster&nbsp;at times.</p><p><b>Do you have any employees or assistants? </b>I have worked with interns, but I complete most of my projects on my own because my work hours are unusual and I can also be very impulsive with my projects. &nbsp;I will come up with an idea and want to execute it within the next day or so.</p><p><b>How do you get paid for public art?</b> &nbsp;Most of my income has been from private or public commissions, meaning that a company or city will come to me with a project proposal.</p><p><b>How much do you earn as a yarn bomber?</b> I am in the beginning of my commercial art career and only make about $20,000 a year from art alone. &nbsp;I have been offered about $35,000, but as I mentioned before many projects fall through.</p><p><b>Would you recommend this line of work to anyone else?</b> I would definitely recommend this job to anyone with self-discipline, drive, and an ability to be flexible. &nbsp;It is a great career for anyone that feels more comfortable working for themselves than for someone else. You should also be comfortable with the unknown, financially.</p><p>Follow TIME contributor Anita Hamilton on twitter: <a href=#>@anitafhamilton</a></p><ul class="full-list group col-1"><li class=item-list><h3>9 Dream Jobs That Pay</h3></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapai2r7HSrGWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWliZH5ye5FwZnJllKeyormMo6abq12ptaLAjJqara2Robm6ec%2BasGirnJ6xpnvJnqqsoZVitaa5zKilrGWplr%2BvecGopJudomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
