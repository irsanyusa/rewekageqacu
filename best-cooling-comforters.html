Not only a comforter, but also cooling sheets and a cooling mattress—the whole package deal. It can be pretty hard to find the best comforters for all the hot sleepers out there, though, since the majority of comforters are designed to keep you warm and cozy. Luckily, many bedding brands have started making cooling comforters for customers who want to have a restful night’s sleep minus the sweat. We’ve rounded up the best cooling comforters to add to your cart, whether you’re shopping for yourself or a loved one.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-cooling-comforters-for-hot-sleepers>What to consider when buying cooling comforters for hot sleepers</h2><h3>Materials</h3><p>When buying a cooling comforter, consider the materials, since they can make a big difference to how you feel during the night. According to Frej Lewenhaupt, textile expert and co-founder and CEO of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Steamery</a>, certain materials are more breathable than others, providing a more cooling effect. “Some naturally cool materials include silk, linen, cotton, lyocell, seersucker, and hemp,” he says. ”These textiles breathe well and allow moisture to pass through them, which makes them feel nice and cool. ” (For an in-depth discussion about two of the most popular materials, see our guide to <a rel=alternate href=#>bamboo vs. cotton sheets</a>.)</p><h3>Thickness</h3><p>Aside from materials, the thickness of the comforter will play a role in how cooling it’ll feel against the skin. “Natural materials like down and wool are usually very breathable but can also insulate well, while synthetic fabrics like polyester are usually light and airy but more likely to attract and trap bad odors,” says Lewenhaupt.</p><h3>Additional Bedding</h3><p>The comforter won’t make much of a difference in how cool you feel during the night if the rest of the bedding isn’t also made with cooling properties in mind. “If you’re using a top sheet made from synthetic material underneath your comforter, it can trap heat and moisture, even with a good, breathable comforter,” says Lewenhaupt. He recommends opting for a top sheet made from natural materials like cotton or silk that will feel cooler against your skin.
