And it seems like returning coaches Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, and Kelly Clarkson are scared of the newcomer. John has already been blocked by all three coaches!</strong></p><p>Here are the acts that John was blocked from coaching in the first week of Blind Auditions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gyth-rigdon>Gyth Rigdon</h3><p>Gyth was the first performer of Season 16. He is a single father from Singer, Louisiana. Gyth auditioned with “Drift Away” and turned Blake, Kelly, and John’s chairs. Though Blake denied it, he was the first one to block John! Gyth is a county/pop/soul singer with a lot of potential on this season. He has a strong voice and, as Kelly mentioned, his “Janis Joplin-style scream” was a big moment in his Blind Audition. After much debate, Gyth chose to join Team Blake.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rizzi-myers>Rizzi Myers</h3><p>Rizzi was my personal favorite from the <a href=# class=broken_link>premiere </a>of The Voice this season! She is a mother of two and songwriter from Nashville. She also has a crazy range and her cover of “Breathin'” by Ariana Grande showed off her control and just what she can do. So when John turned after Kelly and Blake, he was clearly upset not to have a chance to coach her. But let’s be honest, she even brought along a picture with Kelly Clarkson from when she was a teenager. Did John really have a chance any way? This coach/contestant pair seems like the perfect fit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-domenic-haynes>Domenic Haynes</h3><p>Domenic kicked off the second episode of Blind Auditions. But his cover of “River” by Leon Bridges resulted in John’s third block! Adam turned his chair within the first five seconds of Domenic starting the song. From there, John followed his lead, turning pretty quickly after. But he dances and jams, not realizing he’s been blocked until much later. Blake ends up turning at the last second too. This block is a huge bummer for Domenic though! I feel like he would definitely do well under John’s coaching. They have a similar, soulful vibe. But, at least for now, Domenic joined Team Adam. Fingers are crossed he ends up on John’s team at some point!</p><p>But don’t worry, John already has two four-chair turns and he’s an early favorite. His personality is perfect for the show, especially his chemistry with the other coaches. This season of The Voice should be a fun (and competitive) one!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/twb2-1.jpg alt="‘The World’s Best’: What’s Not Working?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571aignJ1dmLyir8dmoaignmK5prPEp5tmmpyksKx7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
