The South Korean boyband will perform their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>new English single </a>“Dynamite.” They made VMA’s history last year for winning the brand new Best K-Pop category for the song “Boy With Love” featuring Halsey. Their performance this year will definitely blow us all away as it will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first time</a> they perform on the high caliber award show.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>BTS Is Performing At The MTV VMA’s</h2><p>Along with performing, the group is nominated in three categories this year including Best Choreography, Best Pop and Best K-Pop for their song “ON.” Their newest track “Dynamite” is set to release ahead of the MTV VMA’s along with a music video on August 21. The promotional image for the song features the song title written in colorful letters with a pink background.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>A LOOK BACK AT 7 BIGGEST BTS MOMENTS ON OFFICIAL BTS ARMY DAY</a></strong></p><p>A promotional schedule for “Dynamite” was also released, making the BTS Army super excited for the first images set to drop on August 10. They will also appear on MTV Fresh Out Live and the TODAY Show on August 22 and 24. In a live stream, the group said the song is “totally new and fresh.” They continued on to say “When we first heard and recorded the song, we were energized and our spirits were lifted up. We can’t wait to share this song with you all and enjoy it together.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/rougebebe00/status/1290992284083912704</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How And When To Watch Their Performance</h3><p>There are several ways to make sure you are tuned in to watch BTS perform at the VMA’s. They will air live from New York City’s Barclays Center on Sunday, Aug. 30 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, presumably without an audience. This is the first live awards show since the coronavirus pandemic has forced social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of the virus. You can watch the VMAs live on the MTV television channel or stream it on MTV.com. The MTV app (available on Google Play, iTunes, Roku, and other platforms) requires you to sign in with your TV provider but is also another effective way to watch. &nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>HOW BTS AND THEIR ARMY ARE SUPPORTING BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT AND FLUSHING OUT RACIST COMMENTS</a></strong></p><p>Other performers announced include Doja Cat and J. Balvin with more expected to be announced within the next few days. Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande’s dynamic pop collaboration for the song “Rain On Me” scored the most nominations as each of the pop divas also were nominated in other categories. The show also features a new category this year for Best Quarantine Performance, a appropriate category added in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Will BTS take home all three of the awards they’re nominated for?
