Lee, using the name ‘Heavens Little Girl [sic]’, had posted a message that appeared to suggest she was looking for a ‘suicide partner’.Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of <a href=#>The Samaritans</a>, told the BBC this week that ‘it is illegal to encourage or assist people to take their own lives - be it on the internet or in any other space - but it is unclear how this legislation can be applied and policed.’<a href=#>The Samaritans</a> stresses that anyone contemplating suicide should talk to friends, family, a GP or call their 24/7 helpline on 08457 90 90 90 (UK) or 1850 60 90 90 (Republic of Ireland).<a href=#>Survey details and full results</a></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpYGZ%2Fbr%2FUopqinJViwKrAxKw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
