Ian and Jim are both members of Team Blake. Though Ian was presumed to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the early frontrunner</a> in the competition, he was left fighting for the Instant Save after last weeks vote. This has led us to believe that he and Jim are fighting for the Team Blake country vote and could very well lead to a split of votes between the two in the finale.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>5 FACTS ABOUT JIM RANGER: THE SOULFUL PASTOR ON ‘THE VOICE’</a></strong></p><p>Jim has gotten a lot of hometown love after his audition of Keith Urban’s “Blue Ain’t Your Color.” If you look at the comments on YouTube on his Blind Audition video, everyone mentions that Jim has the love and support of Bakersfield, California where he currently lives. These votes could possibly give him an edge when going up against an artist like Ian. Jim has also been able to connect with people by openly talking about his faith and love for his family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkzloCZvrL4</p></figure><p>Ian probably has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most unique voice</a> in the entire competition. Week after week, Blake Shelton has said that there is nobody else out there that sounds like Ian. But his past three performances have been a bit linear while other artists have shown off their range. Blake always has a huge fanbase of people that vote for the artists on his team no matter what. But, we truly think that this season, another coach and artist will best the members of Team Blake.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-think-this-fan-favorite-contestant-will-win-the-show>We Think This Fan-Favorite Contestant Will Win The Show</h3><p>While Desz <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>has been very consistent</a> and vocally perfect this season, there has been one contestant who has powered through as the underdog. Carter Rubin, the star of Team Gwen first stunned all of the coaches during his Blind Audition. Just 14 years old at the time he knocked everyone’s socks off. Gwen Stefani declared Carter her “son” very early on and has been like a mother figure to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzG_Wx_g4Ag</p></figure><p>Coming into the Live Shows, Carter has sung all the right songs and gotten so much good advice from Gwen that could truly propel him to win season 19 of The Voice. Even though he is the youngest contestant left in the competition, his vocal prowess, infectious personality and stage presence has been such a huge highlight this season. His take on a Muppets classic last week sent the entire world into a frenzy and led to tons of Google searches and YouTube views that may tip the votes in his favor. It became clear after this performance that the season is Carter’s to win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkSBqACFYmM</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>5 FACTS YOU DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT 14-YEAR-OLD CARTER RUBIN ON ‘THE VOICE’</a></strong></p><p>If Carter wins The Voice, this would be Gwen’s first win as a coach which would be the proper sendoff as she will not be returning as a coach next season. Gwen has already had a huge year, and winning The Voice with Carter would be another huge accomplishment.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kelly-Clarkson.jpeg alt="Kelly Clarkson Says THIS Country Song Helped Her Through The ‘Guilt And Shame’ Of Divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57z6ucnaGTqbawuoywn6hlp565rXnWoqVmrJiaere7yJycZquVlsCwuoxqcGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
