In an attempt to avoid a repetition of the chaotic and overpriced resale market like Taylor Swift’s Eras tour, Ticketmaster has decided to issue tickets only 72 hours before the concert date.

The date additions truly reflect how popular Rodrigo is in the music industry now. The tour’s organizers made the decision to implement this 72-hour rule, highlighting their emphasis on the need for added protection against scalpers.</p><p>Other artists like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed Sheeran</a>, Jack Harlow, and Doja Cat have used this tactic in the past, as it’s not entirely new. However, its effectiveness in addressing scalping remains uncertain. Scalpers often utilize secondary sites to sell “speculative” tickets, a practice that has been under scrutiny.</p><p>The limitation of ticket distribution to 72 hours before the event could potentially lead to a frenzied rush on the secondary market as the deadline approaches. Despite the addition of extra tour dates, all available tickets have already sold out, and Ticketmaster’s FAQ page does not mention any price caps on reselling tickets.</p><p>This move by Ticketmaster is part of the ongoing efforts to combat the predatory secondary ticket market, driven by the Swift ticketing debacle where fans faced technical difficulties and exorbitant resale prices. The Guts tour is set to kick off at the Acrisure Arena in Palm Springs, California, on February 23 next year.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ticketmaster announces big ticket changes for Olivia Rodrigo's "Guts" tour.</p><p>Fans will not be able to access tickets until 72 hours before the event and they will only be available electronically, in the hopes of curbing high resale prices. <a href=#>@eriellereshef</a> has more. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/41QAR5dK1H</a></p>— Good Morning America (@GMA) <a href=#>September 22, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-olivia-rodrigo-faces-backlash-for-high-ticket-prices>Olivia Rodrigo Faces Backlash for High Ticket Prices</h2><p>Alongside the new 72 hour rule, fans are talking about how expensive tickets are for the Guts tour. Since Rodrigo rose to fame from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a> Shows and her music, fans were thrilled when they heard about the Guts tour. Now, after seeing ticket prices, some fans will be unable to attend the event of the year.</p><p>One TikToker, HerculeanKate, made a video that went viral. Within the video, she was really sad because she couldn’t afford the tickets. She showed her computer screen with ticket prices from $510 to $840. The Tiktok user compared this to buying Swift tickets, where she paid less than $300 per ticket.</p><p>Fans also didn’t like the Guts album cover, saying it looked cheap. Ticket prices and fan reactions show it’s hard for artists to make sure tickets are affordable for everyone. Rodrigo’s Guts tour got people talking about ticket prices and how fans feel about it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_SharnaBurgess_BrianAustinGreen_Eric-McCandlessABC-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Sharna Burgess, Brian Austin Green Announce Their Engagement" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706KapJ2koq60wMSrZKydpKh6r7HWZqmupJVis6K60mauoqScYr%2Bmr8SirZ5ln6G2t7XAZqmonKKetLB506isq2WknrCssdOsZHBqXZ28tr7SZpmenp%2Bnsm7Ax55krKCfrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
