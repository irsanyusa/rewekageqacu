Meet them on this list.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Now we’re about to embark on another wild ride. 2024 promises to be filled not just with continued business disruption and economic unpredictability but also with a high dose of political divisiveness.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As always, we need the skills of these dealmakers to negotiate the partnerships, create the wealth and harness the synergies necessary for the industry to overcome whatever economic challenges lie ahead. While not an easy task, this group of this diverse group of men and women have proven they are up to it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">(A side note: the number of women included on this list, though still woefully far from parity, rises each year. This is especially true of the Up Next portion, which indicates that this trend will continue.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Turning to the future, what will the Dealmakers class of 2024 look like? Many of the individuals profiled below will be among its members, but they’ll be joined by new faces as the industry continues to attract the brightest negotiators emerging from the academic and corporate worlds. Until then, enjoy reading about the class of 2023.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For editorial inquiries, please contact Peter Caranicas at peter.caranicas@variety.com and Sharareh Drury at sdrury@variety.com.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Greg Akselrud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Akselrud-Greg-StubbsAlderton-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partner<br>Stubbs Alderton & Markiles</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Besides advising a host of A-listers in their business transactions, Akselrud is known as a go-to corporate dealmaker. This year he was closely involved in financial and/or acquisition transactions for more than a dozen digital media companies and sports equipment retailers, and represented the late Leonard Cohen’s estate in its catalog sale to Hipgnosis Song Management.</p><p><strong>Rebounding post-strikes: </strong>At first, “people were focusing on budgets and wanted to manage their expenses in what was looking like — and actually ended up being — an extended period.” Then, as happened with COVID, “everyone realized that there was a lot of work that could be accomplished to advance their corporate transactions and invest in the future of their brands or entrepreneurial initiatives, knowing that the strikes would ultimately end. It caused a flurry of activity [that] continues<br>to accelerate,” Akselrud says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2><b>Byron Allen</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Allen-Byron-AllenMediaGroup-CR-Michael-Bezjian-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Founder, Chairman, CEO<br>Allen Media Group</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Allen and his dedicated team continued their prolific dealmaking reign during a year filled with turmoil and occasional paralysis. AMG’s free streaming service, Local Now, launched three NBC News FAST Channels as well as a Washington Post FAST Channel, while launching the new court series “Equal Justice With Judge Eboni K. Williams.” AMG Motion Pictures is gearing up to produce a James Baldwin biopic starring Billy Porter, who is co-writing the screenplay with Dan McCabe.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Working through uncertain times: </strong>“The world and our business are always changing and evolving, making it both challenging and exciting,” says Allen. “We see great opportunities in this new landscape. Albert Einstein said it best: ‘The very definition of intelligent life is life that can adapt.’ As always, we will adapt.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lisa Alter, Katie Baron</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Alter-Kendrick-Baron.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners<br>Alter Kendrick & Baron</strong></p><p>Sought after by buyers and sellers of music rights catalogs, copyright lawyers Alter and Baron negotiated more than $3 billion in deals in the past year, including multiple high-profile acquisitions on behalf of BMG Rights Management, Reservoir Media Management, Influence Media, ICM Crescendo and Primary Wave Music Publishing.</p><p><strong>AI’s impact on music catalog investments: “</strong>There’s a lot of litigation around it, so we’ll know more in coming years, but I don’t think it’s as big a risk as some investors have been concerned about,” Alter says. “Our job, when these things come up, is to try and anticipate ways in which … we could include in the purchase agreement enough protection to address technology that’s not even mainstream yet. The flip side is that there are a lot of ways the technology itself can be a tool.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Tom Ara, David Markman, Alexander Steinberg, Katherine Imp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DLA-Piper.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Ara: Partner; Global Co-Chair, Media, Sport & Entertainment Sector<br>Markman Partner; Co-Chair, Entertainment Transactions Practice<br>Steinberg, Imp: Partners<br>DLA Piper</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ara, Markman and Imp work on Lego content deals including reality TV series “Lego Masters.” The Century City-based trio also handles day-to-day matters for Lego productions. New York-based Steinberg advised TV broadcaster The E.W. Scripps Company for the launch a year ago of its sports division, and subsequently TV deals for Vegas Golden Knights and Phoenix Coyotes hockey games, and then for National Women’s Soccer League telecasts. Ara and Markman repped TikTok for the TikTok in the Mix concert and also ongoing virtual reality production, including for its Pico headsets. Other clients include CAA and Victoria’s Secret. Markman advises Jeanie Buss and David McLane for the all-female wrestling org WOW.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Get ready for a wild ride: </strong>Ara says that fast-growing artificial intelligence will roil Hollywood over questions about content ownership, protectability, infringement and engagement. He expects the main issues will be whether “the inputs and outputs in AI infringe on anyone else’s rights.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Audrey Benoualid, Josh Karp, Tamara Milagros-Butler, Robert Minzner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MYMAN-GREENSPAN-FOX.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners<br>Myman Greenspan Fox Rosenberg Mobasser Younger & Light</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With the music industry in a state of flux, these partners navigated rocky terrain to pull off some of the biggest deals of 2023. Benoualid worked on the sale of Justin Bieber’s catalog to Hipgnosis for more than $200 million and helped facilitate Jennifer Lopez’s BMG record and publishing deals. Karp was part of the team that restructured Ariana Grande’s REM cosmetics business and helped wrangled deals for Guns N’ Roses’ upcoming European and North American tours. Milagros-Butler facilitated a joint venture publishing business between Pulse Music and Concord and helped make Erykah Badu’s dreams of having her cannabis strain a reality. Minzner inked the deal for RuPaul’s memoir and smoothed out Mako’s composer and songwriting agreements with Riot Games.<strong></strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>New horizons:</strong> “An artist becoming a partner in a joint venture versus just getting royalties off the sale of their records” is how Milagros-Butler describes one of the burgeoning opportunities for clients. “Take Badu’s deal with Cookies. She’s now the proud owner of a strain of cannabis and that’s proven to be lucrative.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Paul Bernstein, Jim Nelson, Nick Jacobus, Kristen Ruisi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/VENABLE.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Bernstein: Chair, Entertainment Transactions<br>Nelson: Co-Chair, Technology, Media & Commercial<br>Jacobus, Ruisi: Partners<br>Venable</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The quartet repped Peyton Manning’s Omaha Prods. selling a minority stake to Peter Chernin-led North Road in May, and separately Boardwalk Pictures (Netflix’s “Chef’s Table”) in its sale of a minority stake to Shamrock Capital in February. They also advised TV-film producer Automatik (“La La Land”) in its June merger with Range Media Partners. Another client, cryptocurrency exchange OKX, forged a sponsorship deal with Premiere League soccer team Manchester City in June. Bernstein focuses on corporate issues, Nelson on intellectual-property transactions, Jacobus on taxation and Ruisi on trademarks. Bernstein and Jacobus are based in Los Angeles, Nelson in San Francisco and Ruisi in New York.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Thorny issues:</strong> Nelson sees an epic arm-wrestling match unfolding as content creators press for compensation when AI regurgitates their intellectual property. “That’s the puzzle,” he says. “There clearly is a foundational identity and persona for many of our clients who should receive value for their creativity, identity and works.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jeff Biederman, Steve Plinio, Paul Schindler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Greenberg-Taurig.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Biederman, Plinio: Shareholders<br>Schindler: Senior Chair, New York Entertainment & Media Practice<br>Greenberg Traurig</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Major music catalog sales and securitization deals have kept Biederman, Plinio and Schindler extremely busy in 2023, along with striking licensing, branding, publishing and record deals for their star-studded clients. Biederman served as counsel on Apollo Global Management’s record-shattering $1.8 billion music asset-backed securitization of the Concord Music catalog. Plinio facilitated Litmus Music’s acquisition of Katy Perry’s music catalog in an industry-captivating if not always accurately reported (“most of it was incorrect,” he says) deal. Schindler smoothed the way for Open on Sunday to acquire catalogs including songs by Madonna, Metro Boomin, BB King and Keith Sweat.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Estate planning and catalog sales:</strong> “For the artists or the companies, it’s about getting capital gains income instead of ordinary income — and having the money all at once,” Schindler says. Estate planning also plays a role. “Money is fungible, and copyrights are not,” Biederman says. “It’s a lot easier to sell a catalog and hand checks to your various heirs than to have a bunch of people in a room trying to decide whether to use grandpa’s song in a movie.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Ivy Kagan Bierman, Dimitry Krol</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Loeb-Loeb.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Bierman: Chair, Entertainment Labor Group<br>Krol: Senior Counsel<br>Loeb & Loeb</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bierman and Krol, labor law specialists, assisted their wide spectrum of clients to navigate the first dual industry strikes since 1960. At the same time, retaining good relationships with guild execs enabled them to work through complicated strike rule issues to the clients’ benefit. Of particular note: the role they played in obtaining SAG-AFTRA interim agreements for qualifying indie projects, leading to the following note from a prominent thesp, attached to a bouquet of flowers on Bierman’s desk: “Thank you for saving our film.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Proceed with caution:</strong> “I have been speaking publicly, on a regular basis, about my very serious concerns about the breakdown of management-labor relations — the lack of trust and collaboration, and the impact that this is having and may continue to have on our industry,” Bierman says. “My hope is that when the companies are implementing these collective bargaining agreements and the guilds are enforcing them, it won’t exacerbate what is already a tense and frayed relationship.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Dan Black</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Black-Dan-GreenbergTraurig-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Vice Chairman, Global Entertainment & Media Practice<br>Greenberg Traurig</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With the industry taking a battering from strikes and the lingering effects of COVID, the key to Black’s success lies in his “recession-proof” clients. He negotiated a sizeable film and television deal with Paramount Global and Taylor Sheridan for scripted content based on client Willie Nelson’s life, continued to guide Spin Master’s successful “Paw Patrol” franchise, negotiated C-suite employment agreements worth $150 million and — in a sign of the times — separation agreements worth $80 million. He also served as lead counsel for Litmus Music’s catalog acquisitions and facilitated Lashan Browning’s historic joint venture with Paramount.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Deals in hard times: </strong>“I try to keep as varied a practice as possible and identify individuals and companies that have something special about them,” Black says. “During these challenging times, the cream still rises to the top.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jordan Bromley, Christopher Chatham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Manatt-Phelp-Phillips.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Bromley: Leader, Manatt Entertainment<br>Chatham: Partner<br>Manatt, Phelps & Phillips</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bromley, who helped negotiate more than $3 billion in music transactions in the past year, advises notable artists including Diplo, Jack White and Eagles, also representing two of the world’s largest music IP holders. Additionally, he spearheaded the firm’s new music streaming royalty calculator and infographic that tracks creators’ earnings from Spotify and Apple Music. Meanwhile, Chatham, whose client list spans a broad spectrum of the entertainment industry, brokered a deal to transition Dr. Phil from syndie talk show host and author to primetime host on his own network. Other Chatham clients include Logan Paul, Gabriel Macht, Nic Pizzolatto, Julia Boorstin and Heidi Klum.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Influential appeal: </strong>Logan Paul’s Prime beverage “is set to surpass $1.2 billion in annual sales this year, just two years after its launch,” says Chatham. “This type of success has validated the idea that the informal-influencer-style approach, especially to younger consumers, is not going away anytime soon.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Nancy Bruington, Kendall Johnson, Jonathan West, Liliana Paparelli Ranger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Latham-Watkins.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Bruington, Johnson, West: Partners</strong><br><strong>Liliana Paparelli Ranger: Associate&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Latham & Watkins</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Focused on finance, Bruington advised Skydance Media on a $1 billion credit facility and separately New Regency Prods. on a $175 million loan, both in July. Bruington also advised Monroe Capital on acquisition financing for Vin Di Bona Prods. Working entertainment and sports deals, Johnson advised MGM in April regarding subscriber migration and content licensing for MGM+ International in Europe, plus KKR-backed Mediawan buying into Brad Pitt-led Plan B Entertainment. Handling celebrities and companies for personal services agreements, West repped Julia Louis-Dreyfus for a February podcasting pact, Hybe America acquiring hip-hop label Quality Control, also in February, and Shamrock Holdings for Dr. Dre’s music catalog in January. Ranger advised Endeavor in its September megadeal rolling its UFC sports into TKO Group and separately the Houston Rockets acquiring a regional sports network in October. Ranger becomes partner in January 2024, and works production/distribution transactions. All are based in Century City.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Crystal balling:</strong> Johnson sees the industry embracing AI as a content creation tool and to help monetize existing libraries. “Our clients are looking around corners, figuring out the Next Big Thing,” Johnson says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jim Burtson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Burtson-Jim-CAA-CR_Max-S.-Gerber-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>President</strong><br><strong>CAA</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In one of 2023’s decidedly game-changing deals, CAA and Artémis, the Paris-based Pinault family’s investment company and holder of some of the world’s top luxury brands, announced Artémis as the new majority shareholder of the Century City-based entertainment and sports agency — a stake acquired from global investment firm TPG. Although terms were not disclosed, the transaction reportedly values the agency at $7 billion. Per the deal, Singapore-headquartered Temasek, another global investment firm, will remain a minority investor in CAA. China-based CMC Capital continues as a CAA strategic partner.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Looking forward:</strong> “The transaction with Artémis positions CAA with the right&nbsp; majority partner for our next chapter,” says Burtson, who headed the CAA deal team. “Led by François-Henri Pinault, Artémis is that unique combination of a savvy, strategic investor and a truly entrepreneurial operator.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lisa Callif, Chris Perez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lisa-Callif-Chris-Perez.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners</strong><br><strong>Donaldson Callif Perez</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Advocating for independent creators is the core of their practice, as is their commitment to protecting creators’ rights. In the past year, Callif repped the Safdie brothers’ production company, Elara, in transactions for four HBO docuseries, including “Telemarketers.” She also served as legal counsel for MGX Creative, plus closed a financing deal and provided legal work for XTR’s “They Call Me Magic.” Perez provided vital clearance rights work in collaboration with Meadowlark Media and Skydance Sports for the Amazon docuseries “Good Rivals,” and advised director Matt Johnson and Zapruder Films on complex clearance issues associated with the unauthorized biopic “BlackBerry,” later acquired by Universal.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>The AI effect: </strong>“The future of generative AI in the entertainment industry is fascinating,” says Perez. “It’s unlikely to be addressed by federal law anytime soon. Instead, it’ll be shaped by how creators employ the technology and how dealmakers address the possible uses of AI in their deals.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Gerry Cardinale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cardinale-Gerry-RedbirdCapital-CR_Alessandro-BremecNurPhoto-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Founder, Managing Partner, Chief Investment Officer</strong><br><strong>RedBird Capital Partners</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">RedBird Capital handled some of the biggest media and entertainment deals in the past year. It helped the formation of the XFL and its recently announced merger with the USFL. It boosted growth at Skydance Media by navigating a lucrative joint venture deal with the NFL to form Skydance Sports. And it aided the formation of creative production studio Artists Equity in partnership with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. But the firm’s banner achievement was the launch of RedBird IMI with former CNN topper Jeff Zucker, a joint venture investment platform focused on global media, entertainment, sports and news.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Adapting to the times:</strong> “Technological disintermediation has always been a driver of potential new investment opportunities, as long as you can navigate content selection towards the most premium intellectual property,” says Cardinale.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Shaun Clark, Robb Klein, Leif Cervantes de Reinstein, Daniel Schnapp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sheppard-Mullin-Richter-Hampton.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clark, Klein, de Reinstein</strong>: <strong>Partners</strong><br><strong>Schnapp</strong>: <strong>Partner & Leader of the Music,&nbsp;Interactive Media, AI and Technology&nbsp;Transactions Teams&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With more than a century’s worth of experience between them, Clark, Klein, Cervantes de Reinstein and Schnapp have become a transactional go-to team for high-profile clients.

Endeavor offloaded $2.7 billion in debt when contributing its mixed-martial-arts UFC, getting a 51% stake in TKO. McMahon, whose WWE wrestling was the other merger component, sold a $670 million slice of his personal TKO stock in November.

For instance, Milostan signed model-actor Sam Asghari as a client in all of his entertainment matters and is helping him navigate his high-profile divorce from singer Britney Spears. For the most part, it was business as usual. Galsor worked<br>with James on deals for the Russo brothers and their production company,&nbsp; AGBO, and shared the Chris Hemsworth and Ubisoft Entertainment workload with James, while repping such showbiz heavyweights as actor/producer Tom Cruise, director David Fincher, director James Cameron and actor Vin Diesel.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Streaming’s simple math:</strong> “A couple of years ago, people thought there’s an additional billion customers out there,” says Galsor. “At least for now, that’s not the case.

Hodge’s expertise at the merchant bank extends to offering management guidance and strategic counsel to a portfolio of companies where he sits on the board, including Propagate, Imagine Entertainment and advertising measurement tech company VideoAmp.

Two standouts: Karlov helped John Fogerty repurchase rights to the Creedence Clearwater Revival catalog — a long-time goal of the musician — bucking the trend of musicians selling their catalogs; and Thompson represented Peyton Manning and Omaha Prods. in agreements spanning the intersection of sports, music and television, from revamping the NFL Pro Bowl, to hosting the Country Music Awards, to developing an unscripted Netflix series.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Social media micro-licensing:</strong> “There is no micro-license, for lack of a better word, process that serves all of the industry at once, so we really cannot monetize the most extensive use of our intellectual property,” Karlov says. “The music business [has] the opportunity to figure it out and create the model … and whoever figures out that model — including if they can figure it out on a national or international basis, such that all owners and licensors can partake — they’ll make fortunes.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Alan Klein, Anthony Vernace, William Allen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Simpson-Thacher-Bartlett.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Simpson Thacher & Bartlett</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As deal counsel to Microsoft, this New York-based team did much of the heavy lifting on the most consequential gaming deal of 2023: the software giant’s $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which closed on Oct. 13 after a protracted period of global regulatory review.

He also pulled off a rare trifecta by negotiating Usher’s Super Bowl LVIII Halftime performance — having previously done it for Gaga and the Weeknd. For his part, Jacobs represented Zach Bryan on his ascent to the very pinnacle of the music industry.

He negotiated stand-up comedian Taylor Tomlinson’s deal to host “After Midnight,” CBS’ new late-night franchise, as well as two upcoming Netflix comedy specials. Miller also hammered out the deal for Da’Vine Joy Randolph’s scene-stealing role in Alexander Payne’s “The Holdovers,” which is generating Oscar buzz.

More recently, he’s been working on the $30 million sale of an animation company, the $100 million merger of two prolific TV production companies and the acquisition of rights and financing of “Rush Hour 4.” Savranskaia carried a workload that included documentary and publishing deals for James Cameron and producing pacts for Tommy Harper (“Beetlejuice 2”) and Robby Kenner (“Food Inc. 2”), while Webb handled the Marley family’s producing and rights deals on the Paramount biopic “Bob Marley: One Love.” Fenton was busy negotiating celebrity endorsement agreements for Kim Kardashian’s brand Skims and Khloe Kardashian’s brand Good America.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Waiting for the post-strike stampede:</strong> “There are a lot of daily network shows that resumed very quickly, but in terms of bigger-budget series and films, right now everybody’s sort of figuring out how to get everybody ready to hit the ground running in the new year,” says Webb.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Christian Muirhead, Richard Weitz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WME.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Co-Chairmen</strong><br><strong>WME</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The duo worked on acquiring the remaining ownership of Bill Duffy’s NBA players agency BDA Sports in March, and literary Ross Yoon Agency in June, which plants WME’s flag in Washington, D.C. For Americana music touring, New York-based Muirhead and Beverly Hills-based Weitz grew WME’s Nashville footprint in April with the acquisition of Red 11 Music and, separately, True Grit Talent Agency in Austin in August. All those acquisitions bolster the talent agency’s business in areas not impacted by the now-ended Hollywood labor strikes, which clipped revenue at parent Endeavor by tens of millions of dollars. The stoppage was painful, but Muirhead notes it also nudged clients to investigate books, touring, podcasting, videogames and income-generating social media.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Triumph over adversity: </strong>“Despite all the headwinds, there are a tremendous amount of opportunities,” Muirhead observes. “There’s that old adage ‘in chaos, there is opportunity’ and the clients have proved that’s the case.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sonia Nijjar, Ken King, Chris Bors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Skadden-Arps-Slate-Meagher-Flom.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Microsoft’s $75 billion acquisition of videogamer Activision Blizzard was demanding before the deal was signed, with arm-wrestling over price, due-diligence reviews and crafting complex agreements. Nijjar, King and Bors worked that early dealmaking for Activision and the also grueling and unusually lengthy 20 months of regulatory approvals that followed — a process that spanned the globe. The hang-ups were in the U.S., where the government asked a court to temporarily block but lost, and the U.K., which resolved in September. Sticky issues included consumer protections over cloud computing and online subscriptions.
