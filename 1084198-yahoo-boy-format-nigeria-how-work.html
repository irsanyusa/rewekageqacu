To pull off <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the scam</a>, the fraudster will do several things meant to portray them as real estate agents or realtors. This often includes creating a nice-looking website. The fraudster will then upload fake photos of luxurious <a href=#>houses</a> purporting to be selling the properties.</p><p class=align-left>An unsuspecting buyer, lured by the images, decides to make payment into a specified account to purchase the property. In reality, the property depicted in those images is never for sale or is actually located in another country. Once the payment has been made, the fraudster shuts down the website or blocks the person who made the payment.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6899cbff1ace36c5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Internet for teenagers: discover the pros and cons</span></p></a><h4>ATM fraud</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fcd6eca9e3fe87ab.jpg><p class=align-left>This method typically targets old people or those with reading-related challenges. To pull off <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the trick</a>, the Yahoo boy will hover around an unmanned ATM and wait for their target to approach. They will then pretend to offer them assistance in withdrawing their money. Several things could then happen, including an ATM card swap or deduction of the withdrawn amount.</p><h4>Phishing</h4><p class=align-left>This is one of the more advanced but still common Yahoo boy techniques. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Phishing involves</a> illegally acquiring another person's private data. For fraudsters, <a href=#>some important information</a> includes credit card data, usernames, passwords, and <a href=#>phone numbers</a>. This is often done via phishing software, often downloaded and installed by an unsuspecting user.</p><h4>Price baiting</h4><p class=align-left>This is a technique <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">designed to prey</a> on the normal human being's affinity for discounted products. A scammer will create a product site, say, dealing with automotive sales. They will then upload photos of cars with significantly lower prices than the average market rate. The victim will then call, enquiring about a specific model.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4946fe414e33862d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>1960bet mobile registration, betting tips, live betting, contact numbers, branches.</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At this point, they will be asked to pay about half the amount to 'book' the vehicle and prevent it from being purchased by another person. Once the victim makes the payment, the scammers disappear, at times even shutting down the website.</p><h4>Web freestyle</h4><p class=align-left>Most fraudsters in Nigeria reportedly start with this Yahoo format. The method involves creating <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a fake profile</a> on the most popular dating websites. The scammer then poses as a needy student, divorced wife/husband, or any other persona to stir their victims' emotions. Once the victim falls in love with the impersonator, they will probably begin sending them money before deciding to meet in person.</p><h4>Unsolicited email</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6899cbff1ace36c5.jpg><p class=align-left>This scam is designed to prey on people who love winning free stuff. The scammers collect numerous emails belonging to locals and foreigners. They then <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">send them emails</a> notifying them that they have won a jackpot or lottery. The victim is then asked to send a small amount as a 'processing fee' for the award. Once they send the amount, the scammer cuts all communication.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a9aeb6fab7ac8c7c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>An expert guide on how to play SportyBet: Registration, login, mobile app</span></p></a><h3>What do Yahoo boys use to facilitate their trade?</h3><p class=align-left>Here is a look at the societal vices, circumstances, tech advancements, and networks that facilitate the Yahoo boy problem.</p><h4>Timing</h4><p class=align-left>Most Yahoo boys who engage in bank-related fraud, such as credit card phishing, ATM fraud, and price baiting, do so on weekends. This is because most banks are closed, meaning the victim cannot do much to stop or reverse their transactions. By the time banks reopen on Monday, most of the victims' money is usually gone.</p><h4>Bank networks</h4><p class=align-left>Most Yahoo boys have contacts on the inside. This makes it extremely easy for them to withdraw money obtained via illegal means. If a person obtains an ATM card from an older person, gets their PIN and then swaps it, they can walk in and have their teller attendant on the inside withdraw large amounts of cash for them. This, of course, happens at a fee.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e763036012b6bab0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover how to play and win with NaijaBet</span></p></a><h4>Corruption and societal rot</h4><p class=align-left>In Nigeria, modern-day society praises wealth, regardless of how it was acquired. This makes vices such as 419-fraud quite prevalent since the scammers will get social admiration even when their wealth has been earned illegally.</p><h4>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</h4><p class=align-left>Before the advent of VPNs, it was quite easy to trace a person carrying out internet fraud. This was because their IP address was easily visible and traceable. VPNs make this tracing very tricky since they essentially mask a person's actual location and instead show them to be located elsewhere, most times in a different country.</p><h4>Internet, smartphones, and laptops</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1183f2e94fcbd2d4.jpg><p class=align-left>These are the tools of the trade for virtually every Yahoo boy.
